Maxwell is gone for a golden duck. What a huge wicket. Short of a length, top of off or thereabouts, Maxwell looks to punch at it with an open face. The face is just too open. Edges it to Dhoni. Actually off the face of the bat. This game has turned on its head. 42/3 Previous NextSee all photosTushar Deshpande4047011.75104350Maheesh Theekshana403609.0041200Mustafizur Rahman402947.251231204.3 to F du Plessis, The Fizz strikes in his first over this IPL. The cutter from Mustafizur. Bowls at 130ks, on a length, outside off, du Plessis early into it, and ends up miscuing it to deep point. 41/14.6 to RM Patidar, double strike for the Fizz. He has been done in by pace again. A Test-match dismissal. On a good length, wobble-seam, just going with the angle. No feet from Patidar, slightly late on it, edges it through. 41/211.2 to V Kohli, tiki-taka catch between Rahane and Ravindra at midwicket. Looks like a slightly slower ball, which is why Kohli has not got all on this pull, and Rahane takes the diving catch at deep midwicket and lobs it to Ravindra before sliding into the boundary cushions. 77/411.4 to C Green, four for Fizz. Hits the top of leg. The cutter from Mustafizur. Short of a length, pitches outside leg, Green makes room to look to crash it into the covers.

This is excellent bowling and also excellent captaincy from Faf to keep the slip in. Keeps it on a length but well outside off stump. Gaikwad gets forward reaching for the drive. He gets a thick edge and Green takes a fairly simple catch albeit on the second attempt. Important wicket for RCB. 38/1See all photosAlzarri Joseph3.4038010.3651240Karn Sharma2024112.00403006.6 to R Ravindra, He's gone now! One shot too many for Rachin. Was a length ball on middle and leg. He sweeps eyeing another six, but doesn't connect as cleanly. Deep backward square leg settles himself and takes a comfortable catch.

Back of a length ball but the line was crucial here. It was outside off, which meant Rahane had to fetch it and he could not control his pull. Maxwell is a few steps in from the boundary. But he adjusts well, and takes a reverse-cupped catch over his head. 99/312.3 to DJ Mitchell, The short ball does the trick for Green! Banged in short outside off, Mitchell was looking to go over long-on.

Mustafizur Rahman, who was among four debutants for CSK, took out four of Royal Challengers Bengaluru's top five in the space of ten balls to set up an eighth successive defeat for RCB in Chennai.Rachin Ravindra, who was playing his first IPL game, also played his part in the victory, with 37 off 15 balls at a strike rate of 246.66 on a pitch that slowed down later in the night. In his first game as CSK captain, Ruturaj Gaikwad started with a first-ball four, but RCB's Impact Player Yash Dayal cut his innings short on 15 in CSK's chase of 174.Cameron Green and Alzarri Joseph then briefly silenced the Chepauk crowd with their contrasting styles. While Green bowled slower cutters into the pitch, Joseph operated at high speeds and generated steep bounce, taking the pitch out of the equation.2:42Do RCB have an overseas combination problem?Shivam Dube, who was working his way back from injury, replaced Mustafizur as an Impact Player for CSK and laboured to 7 off 13 balls. But he then turned up the tempo to usher CSK home with an unbeaten 34 off 28 balls along with Ravindra Jadeja, who scored an unbeaten 25 off 17. MS Dhoni didn't get to bat in the chase, but perhaps this is what he had hoped for when he handed over the keys of the CSK kingdom to Gaikwad.RCB's Jekyll-and-Hyde powerplayAfter opting to bat in what was his first IPL game as an opposition player in Chennai, Faf du Plessis dashed out of the blocks, hitting seven fours in the first three overs. He latched on to any width that Deepak Chahar and Tushar Deshpande offered, repeatedly pumping them over the off-side infield. Gaikwad got into the act and pushed extra cover back to deep cover and, on cue, Mustafizur had du Plessis holing out to Rachin Ravindra there for 35 off 21 balls. Three balls later, Mustafizur found a bit of extra bounce to have Rajat Patidar nicking off for a duck. Then, in the final over of the powerplay, Chahar had Glenn Maxwell guiding one straight into Dhoni's gloves, also for a duck.After being on 37 for no loss in the first four overs, RCB lost three wickets for five runs in the next two.1:26Moody: 'RCB were predictable with short-ball plan'Mustafizur goes bang-bang once againMustafizur then returned in the 12th over and dismissed Virat Kohli and Green in the space of three balls. While Kohli dragged a pull off a seam-up delivery to deep midwicket for 21 off 20 balls, Green was bowled by a whippy cutter for 18 off 22 balls. It was Mustafizur's second double-wicket over.Mustafizur might not even have played had CSK's death-overs specialist Matheesha Pathirana been fit. He ended up with figures of 4-0-29-4 on a night where the other two seamers in his team - Chahar and Deshpande - went at well over nine an over. When Pathirana returns to action, CSK will have a happy selection headache.Rawat and Karthik prop up RCBThat RCB finished with 173 for 6 was down to a counterattacking 95-run partnership for the sixth wicket off just 50 balls that ended off the last ball of the innings courtesy a Dhoni direct hit.At one stage, RCB went 28 balls without a boundary, but Rawat then hit two in six balls to set RCB up for the end overs. He then walloped Deshpande for 6,6, 4 in a 25-run 18th over. At the other end, Karthik looked rusty to start with, but mixed power with inventiveness to give RCB's innings more impetus.Dube gets the job done for CSKAfter CSK lost Gaikwad in the powerplay, Ravindra lined up RCB's quicks with pulls and pick-up shots. He even whacked Karn Sharma over midwicket for six, but when he went for another six, he holed out to deep square-leg.Ajinkya Rahane (27 off 19 balls) and Daryl Mitchell (22 off 18) made cameos to take the chase deep in typical CSK style. But when Green snagged Mitchell, CSK still needed 64 off 45 balls. The two-bouncer rule empowered Joseph to run in hard and hit the deck even harder. Dube, however, just about passed the short-ball test and sealed the chase with six wickets and eight balls to spare.Mustafizur RahmanRachin RavindraRuturaj GaikwadShivam DubeMS DhoniChennai Super KingsRoyal Challengers BengaluruRCB vs CSKIndian Premier LeagueDeivarayan Muthu is a sub-editor at ESPNcricinfoLanguageEnglishWin ProbabilityCSK 100%RCBCSK100%50%100%RCB InningsCSK InningsOver 19 • CSK 176/4CSK won by 6 wickets (with 8 balls remaining)Powered by Smart StatsMatch CoverageAll Match NewsA first glimpse of Gaikwad's Super KingsMS Dhoni did have moments of influence over this game, but the headline belonged to someone elseFleming on CSK captaincy change: 'We weren't ready for Dhoni to move aside in 2022, but the timing is right now'Head coach says it was Dhoni's decision to step down from the captaincy after a \"lot of consideration\"Du Plessis on opening-day defeat: 'We were always a little bit behind'\"I felt we were 15 or 20 runs short on a pitch that wasn't as bad as we played in the first ten overs\"Mustafizur stars as Gaikwad's CSK start title defence with comfortable win over RCBRachin Ravindra and Shivam Dube played key roles with the bat as CSK won by six wicketsCSK vs RCB, Live blog: Mustafizur extends CSK's dominance over RCBIPL 2024 is here, buckle up!

If you missed any of the action, Deiva's report will be in soon. That's it from us tonight. Thanks everyone for tuning in. It's a double-header tomorrow and we will be live nice and early to bring all the action. Till then, this is me Ashish signing off on behalf of Sidharth, Thilak and Chandan. Ciao!Mustafizur Rahman is the player of the match for his 4 for 29. CSK captain, Ruturaj Gaikwad: Total control right from the start. 2-3 overs here and there but once the spinners came on, we were in control. 10-15 runs lesser would have been great but they came back well. [Turning point?] To get Maxwell and even Faf out, the quick wickets were the turning point. Helps to control the next five-six overs. That was the main point. [Captaincy debut] I have always enjoyed it. Haven't felt the additional pressure, right from the state side. Not even a single time I felt pressurized by anything. Obviously had Mahi bhai with me. [On the chase] Everyone is a stroke-player in our side, even Jinx. There is role clarity in the batting unit. Helps a lot. Lots of positives, but two-three things to work on. The batting, everyone chipped in. If we had a few batters from the top-order batting through, the chase would have been easier.Presentation time.Some stat nuggets from Sampath:- This is the 8th consecutive win for CSK vs RCB at Chepauk, the longest winning streak for any team against an opponent at a venue in IPL. Next best streak is for MI, who have won their last seven matches vs KKR at Wankhede.- Ravindra Jadeja unbeaten in a successful IPL chase for the 27th time, joint-most by any batter, alongside MS Dhoni.Amey: \"Credit to Jadeja for playing only 2 dot balls and keeping the scoreboard moving, especially when Dube was struggling.\"Afeef: \"RCB needed a better plan than just bowling short balls. Alzarri could've been used better, I feel.\"Rachin Ravindra: Pretty complete performance by us. We held our nerves. Batting with Jinx [Rahane] and Rutu, very calm heads. Lucky we had 4-5 days of good training. I find it easier going from red ball to white ball because I think the positions are the same, [Form] It's been good. The wickets were a bit different in training but I backed myself in the game. The experience of the amazing crowd was great. Helps a lot.Faf du Plessis: You have to get ahead in the first six overs. Chennai squeeze you with their spinners. We lost too many wickets in the first six overs. We were 15-20 runs short on a pitch that wasn't as bad as we played in the first ten overs We were always a little bit behind trying to get ahead of the game. They were always ahead of the game. [Short ball plan] Dube wasn't comfortable with the short ball, we were trying to get a few wickets in the middle overs. But didn't happen. [Batting first] If you look at the stats, it is very in favour of batting first. It looked a bit on the drier side. The spinners, in the second innings, the ball started to grip a bit. We backed our seamers against Dube. But batting first was the right decision. [On DK and Rawat] Really good for Dinesh setting up the season for someone who hasn't really played a lot of cricket in the last year. Really important knock for himself. Rawat showed some really promise even last year. He showed composure.11.55pmAnd the wait continues. That is eight wins on the bounce for CSK against RCB at Chepauk. And a clinical win it was to kick-off IPL 2024. It was Rachin Ravindra, on IPL debut, who gave the chase a flying start with a 15-ball 37. Rahane also did his bit scoring a quick 27. RCB did come back into the game with a few quick wickets as they adopted the short ball plan. But I felt they over-did it. Dube was clearly struggling initially, but once he survived, run-scoring was easy. Jadeja did his bit in rotating the strike, and eventually CSK got home with eight balls to spare. While RCB's middle order collapsed, CSK had all their batters contributing. And that was the difference between the two teams.18.44lbAlzarri Joseph to Dube, 4 leg byesThat's that! CSK's winning run against RCB at Fort Chepauk continues. There is a review, but more in desperation, I think. Aims for the yorker that hits Dube's pad and goes to the fine leg fence. Ball tracker confirms the ball pitched outside leg. Ruturaj Gaikwad has made a winning start to his captaincy tenure.CSK vs RCBMATCHESWWLWW18.36Alzarri Joseph to Dube, SIX runsTONKED!

Arshdeep has got lucky with this one. 39/118.3 to Sumit Kumar, now Arsh goes full, 134ks, seam slanting towards slip, and there is a bit of movement in the air to take the edge on the attempted big hit from Sumit. 147/8See all photosKagiso Rabada403619.0012141010.4 to SD Hope, Rabada comes back. This length ball, bowled at 141ks, might have just stopped a touch on him and Hope almost plays a check-drive straight and low to short cover. 94/3Harpreet Brar301414.667100013.2 to RK Bhui, appeal for catch down the leg side, the umpire calls it a wide, and PBKS review it. This is fired into the pads, Bhui gets inside it, looks for a tickle fine to fine leg, and UltraEdge confirms he has gloved it. A second catch decision successfully reviewed by PBKS. 111/5Rahul Chahar403318.256310015.4 to T Stubbs, looks for the inside-out chip over extra cover, but again the lack of turn for Chahar perhaps means he ends up hitting it much straighter than desired. Shashank makes a good run to his left from long-off and completes a diving catch. And credit where it's due: this ball does drift in to hit him on the inner half of the bat. 128/6Harshal Patel4047211.75762007.6 to DA Warner, lovely slower bouncer. Harshal is celebrating a catch at the wicket, but the umpire hasn't given it. PBKS review it. Ultra Edge confirms there is a bit of a tope edge and also a chunk of the glove on the ball. Warner has to go. 74/212.4 to RR Pant, Patel makes up for the drop catch. And again with the slower short ball. Bowled at 123ks, Pant looks to ramp it behind square, but the lack of pace means he ends up lobbing a catch to backward point. Pant is furious with himself. 111/4See all photosPunjab Kings (T: 175 runs from 20 ovs)BATTING RBM4s6sSRShikhar Dhawan (c) b Sharma22161740137.50Jonny Bairstow run out (Sharma)932220300.00Prabhsimran Singh c Warner b Kuldeep Yadav26173250152.94Sam Curran b Ahmed63477261134.04Jitesh Sharma †st †Pant b Kuldeep Yadav991110100.00Liam Livingstone not out 38213823180.95Shashank Singh c †Pant b Ahmed011000.00Harpreet Brar not out 22400100.00Extras(lb 2, w 6)8TOTAL19.2 Ov (RR: 9.15)177/6Did not bat: Harshal Patel, Kagiso Rabada, Rahul Chahar Fall of wickets: 1-34 (Shikhar Dhawan, 3.1 ov), 2-42 (Jonny Bairstow, 3.5 ov), 3-84 (Prabhsimran Singh, 9.2 ov), 4-100 (Jitesh Sharma, 11.3 ov), 5-167 (Sam Curran, 18.3 ov), 6-167 (Shashank Singh, 18.4 ov) • DRSBOWLINGOMRWECON0s4s6sWDNBKhaleel Ahmed4043210.757800018.3 to SM Curran, Heaves across the line, Curran misses but not Khaleel. Offcutter on a length, lands outside off and comes back in. Curran was too early on the shot and it hit top of off. Preity Zinta applauds and is all smiles as Curran walks back. 167/518.4 to Shashank Singh, Shashank has been bounced out first ball, Khaleel on a hat-trick. Pacy and at the armpit, the batter was done for pace and cramped for room as he tried to pull. Ball popped off the glove for Pant to take a dolly. Khaleel and Pant share a glance of understanding, this seems to be a plan coming off. 167/6See all photosIshant Sharma201618.00830303.1 to S Dhawan, Ishant rattles middle stump! He wins the battle of the Delhiites. Dhawan danced down, looked premeditated, and tried to heave across the line. Looked to have bounced lower than Dhawan expected. The 137ks ball zipped past him.

Googly at 83ks is full and outside off, Prabhsimran tried to thrash it over the fielder but found Warner at long-on. Looked to have dipped a bit. 84/311.3 to JM Sharma, Another appeal for stumping. Pant is all smiles. Is Jitesh walking? Sent upstairs. Was a length ball down leg, Jitesh went for the expansive reverse sweep. He missed it and was mid-jump and out of the crease. Meanwhile, Pant lunged low, stretched his upper body as far forward as he could and pushed the ball into the stumps.

Porel smashed 32 off just ten balls to lift them to 174 for 9.But that also meant Capitals were going to be a bowler light during the chase. Ishant Sharma's injury - he hurt his ankle after bowling just two overs - set them back further.RelatedPant on his comeback to cricket: 'I was pretty nervous'Shikhar Dhawan and Jonny Bairstow started the Kings' chase positively but both fell in the fourth over. Kuldeep Yadav then dismissed Prabhsimran Singh and Jitesh Sharma to keep Capitals in the game.But Curran and Livingstone took over after that and added 67 off 42 balls for the fifth wicket. Curran was out in the 19th over, for 63 off 47, but Livingstone stayed till the end and finished the game with a muscular six with four balls to spare.Warner, Marsh give Capitals a breezy startWith Prithvi Shaw left out, David Warner and Mitchell Marsh opened the innings for Capitals and gave them a fast start. Marsh got going by hitting two fours off the first two balls he faced, from Curran. Warner joined in by carting Arshdeep Singh for a six and a four in the next over.Marsh then hit a six each off Kagiso Rabada and Arshdeep. He fell for 20 off 12 when he drove Arshdeep to cover-point where Rahul Chahar took a sharp, overhead catch.Warner kept batting aggressively and even flick-scooped Rabada for a six as Capitals finished the powerplay on 54 for 1. In the seventh over, Shai Hope, on IPL debut, danced down the track and lofted Chahar for a straight six.It was all Capitals at that stage till Harshal Patel came to Kings' rescue, having Warner caught behind with a slower bouncer.Pant's first outing after the accidentWarner's wicket brought Pant to the crease, and the Mullanpur crowd welcomed him with a standing ovation. Playing his first competitive game in 15 months, Pant looked a bit rusty. He was given a life on 4 when Harshal lost the ball in the sun at deep midwicket and ended up gifting a four.As if to rub it in, Pant then drove Harshal for his second boundary. Two balls later, though, Harshal bowled a slower bouncer; Pant failed to spot it and ended up popping it to backward point. His first outing with bat on comeback ended on 18 off 13 balls.3:06Moody on Porel: That's how impact subs should be usedThe Porel gamble pays offHarpreet Brar and Chahar dented Capitals further. Brar had Ricky Bhui caught down the leg side, and Tristan Stubbs holed out to long-off while trying an inside-out shot against Chahar.When Axar Patel was run out coming back for a second, Capitals were reduced to 137 for 7 with 2.5 overs to go. But, coming in as the Impact Player, Porel slashed hard at a short and wide delivery from Harshal and picked up a boundary to deep third.After 19 overs, Capitals were 149 for 8. With Harshal bowling the last over, Kings would have expected to restrict Capitals under 160. But that's when Porel decided to have a say in matters, and smashed three fours and two sixes in a 25-run final over.That lifted Capitals to 174 for 9. At the start of the 20th over, ESPNcricinfo's Forecaster had Capitals' chances of winning at 38.9%. Porel singlehandedly lifted that number to 56.7%.Dhawan, Bairtsow start with a flurry of foursJust like the Capitals openers, Dhawan and Bairstow also started with positive intent. In the first three overs, they hit a combined six fours and looted 34 runs. However, both fell in the fourth over. Dhawan was bowled as he charged down the ground to Ishant, and Bairstow was run-out at the non-striker's end when a Prabhsimran drive brushed a diving Ishant's fingers and crashed into the stumps.But, in the sixth over, Prabhsimran tucked one towards midwicket, from where Ishant charged and fielded the ball. But as he was about to throw, he twisted his right ankle and had to be carried off the field.1:47Has Harshal become too predictable?Kuldeep keeps Capitals in the gameIn the tenth over, Prabhsimran tried to go big against Kuldeep and holed out to long-on for a 17-ball 26, which included five fours. In the spinner's next over, Jitesh attempted a reverse sweep, but not only did he miss the ball, he also lost his balance and ended up out of his crease. Pant was alert behind the stumps and broke the wickets.Kuldeep finished with figures of 2 for 21. He could have easily picked up a third, but Tristan Stubbs, running to his right from long-on, put down Curran, who was on 33 at that point.Curran, Livingstone take overKings needed 63 from the last six overs when Curran and Livingstone clubbed Marsh for 18 to calm the nerves.Capitals still had hope when 28 were required from three overs. But with Ishant off the field, Pant had no option but to bowl Marsh again. He conceded another 18 to finish with 52 from his four wicketless overs.In the 19th over, Khaleel dismissed Curran and Shashank Singh off successive deliveries but it was too late by then. Warner dropping Brar on the last ball of the Khaleel over didn't help either.With just six required from the final over, Sumit Kumar, who was making his IPL debut, had little chance against a set Livingstone.

He didn't get a big score but looked happy and healthy, which has been the theme leading up to now. Hope that continues and that Ishant's fine. Updates will be in about that soon and you'll be able to check it out here. If Kings manage to get most from their resources, they'll have a good season. For now, the second game's started. KKR are struggling against SRH. Do follow that, and take care.Sujit: \"So Porel's innings ensures that Delhi don't take a big NRR hit. But they really need to spruce their bowling. I mean Khaleel and Marsh as front line bowlers is an invitation to the opposition to indulge themselves.\"Sam Curran, POTM: Really pleased, didn't know how the ground would play. Amazing way to start. Nothing better than starting with a win at home. [Chat when Axar, Kuldeep were bowling] Those two are world-class bowlers and play a lot of cricket for India, thought we could take it deep with them being a bowler down. We were in a good position, and then to be with my great mate Liam, was pretty special. [Surviving the dropped chance] At that stage, you gotta take those risks, thankfully luck was on my side there. I knew after surviving it, one of us had to take it to the end Thought the wicket got better under lights, was a good pitch. Ground was big but the ball was travelling well, not much spin and ball was coming on nicely from the pacers. [Did you ask Dhawan for more overs] We got some great options, nice additions too, maybe it'll be different in Bangalore. Most importantly, we won.Shikhar Dhawan, Kings captain: Feels great, happy to be on the ground. I've been preparing for this tournament, this is the first time I'm playing at this high a level since the last IPL. I was a bit nervous as well but yeah, came through. No chat in the innings break after the 25-run over because I was preparing to bat. Also, bowlers will be going through their own emotions. So I would rather give them space and chat after things calm down. I felt we leaked a few extra runs, of course extra nerves are there in the first match. It's normal. Felt the wicket got better under lights, we got a good start and Sam played an amazing innings. Livingstone finished it nicely. [Decision to bowl first] I didn't know the records here, it's a new ground. So didn't focus on it too much, we practiced during day and at night. Thought we'd let the other team use their brains first and then we'll assess it. It worked for us, so we're happy and content.Machakaari : \"DC didn't win the crucial moments. But for Kuldeep and Axar,Their bowling looks seriously weak. Fielding below par to say the least\" I still can't get over Warner dropping a catch.Rishabh Pant, DC captain: Ishant's injury was clearly evident because we were anyway one player short because we lagged with the batting a bit. Abhishek came in and chipped in with a few runs which were crucial. We were short on extra bowling. We actually pulled it back in the end [but couldn't complete the job], part and parcel of the game. [Batting] Personally I was pretty nervous but you have to go through this when you enter the field. This isn't the first time being nervous, but happy about that [return overall]. I think we had a par score but because we were one bowler short, because of an injury, can't do much about it. Wicket played as we expected to play, can't make excuses. We will learn from it but having one bowler short is never good. End of the day, well played to them [Kings] I guess. Porel's finish helped us finish on a high. It was an amazing innings, congrats to him. I think it's just his third or fourth game but the kind of impact he made was huge. Really looking forward [to seeing him] this season.7:19pm It was a seesaw battle but Kings were often in front. For Capitals, Ishant twisting an ankle in the field was a big blow. Especially since it was in the sixth over. The bowlers, Marsh and Khaleel in particular, not coming good cost them. Curran, pushed up to No. 4, was spectacular. Bairstow and Dhawan gave Kings a decent start but fell quickly, so Curran held the innings together amid Kuldeep looking threatening as ever. Axar was trying his best to play a holding role. Sumit, who had to be brought in, was expensive. Curran and Livingstone used the short boundary to their advantage, especially when it was behind them and the bowlers went short. Capitals pulled it back a bit late in the innings, Khaleel got Curran but it wasn't enough with Livingstone and his clean hitting taking the hosts home, in their new home.Afeef: \"Last season Livingstone played one of his best T20 knocks against DC but PBKS failed to get over the line. I'm glad he could finish off this chase against DC today.\"19.26Sumit Kumar to Livingstone, SIX runsClean as a whistle, slugged over cow corner and Punjab Kings start their journey in Mullanpur with a win.

Bit of a slot ball, really, and Iyer was looking to cash in with a hard-handed drive. But he couldn't have picked out the fielder better, Jansen staying low to clutch the ball to his chest. Second wicket of the evening for SRH. 32/23.5 to SS Iyer, chipped to mid-off! Superb take above his head by Cummins, and SRH have taken a third wicket inside the powerplay. Full from Natarajan and Shreyas was looking to loft it over the off side, almost cleared the man on the edge of the ring... but his opposite number is a tall bloke and reels in the catch. First down payment on that INR 20.5 crore fee from Cummins. 32/319.1 to RK Singh, top-edged in the slog, taken at long-on! Rinku knows he has to go (or get Russell on strike).

Agarwal pulls but off the higher side of the bat. The longer side of the boundary comes into play, as Rinku takes it low. 60/119.3 to Shahbaz Ahmed, finds long-on! The crowd at Eden suddenly wakes up from sleep. Shahbaz falls, leaving this on the knife's edge. Harshit went on the shorter side of a length, while angling it across.

Someone listen to the deafening roar at Eden. Suyash, placed at short third, had to half-turn around while moving back and keeping his eyes on the ball. It arrived on him over his right shoulder, and he tumbled to take it. Another slower ball from Harshit, as he rolls his fingers over it. Bowls on a hittable length, though, and just outside off. Klaasen has a go at it aiming for the leg side, but plays early and gets it off a top edge. 204/7See all photosVarun Chakravarthy4055113.758170011.4 to AK Markram, nabbed at deep midwicket!

The man in the deep had to move a few steps to his left, and end at where an imaginary straightish fine leg would have been. Russell dug one a short at Abhishek, with the ball climbing nicely towards the batter's throat on middle and leg. He went for the pull, but top-edged it, with the extra pace getting the ball to zip through off the pitch. 71/216.5 to Abdul Samad, straight to deep midwicket! The fielder was placed right on the edge of the rope, and that arrived at a comfortable height, in front of his stomach. It was a full toss which was dipping just outside off, as Samad wasn't able to time his swing. He waited for a few seconds to confirm if it wasn't an above-waist no-ball or not, before heading back. But he's asked to wait, as the umpires take a look again. And replays confirm it arrived at him just below the waist, so it is not a no-ball. 145/5See all photosSuyash Sharma201809.0031100Unlocking the magic of StatsguruMATCH FLOWKolkata Knight Riders inningsPowerplay 1: Overs 0.1 - 6.0 (Mandatory - 43 runs, 3 wickets)Kolkata Knight Riders: 50 runs in 7.1 overs (43 balls), Extras 3Strategic Timeout: Kolkata Knight Riders - 66/4 in 9.0 overs (PD Salt 33, Ramandeep Singh 12)Kolkata Knight Riders: 100 runs in 11.4 overs (71 balls), Extras 45th Wicket: 50 runs in 27 balls (PD Salt 14, Ramandeep Singh 35, Ex 1)PD Salt: 50 off 38 balls (3 x 4, 3 x 6)Over 15.2: Review by Sunrisers Hyderabad (Bowling), Decision Challenged - Wide, Umpire - YC Barde, Batter - AD Russell (Upheld)Strategic Timeout: Kolkata Knight Riders - 141/6 in 16.0 overs (RK Singh 10, AD Russell 20)Kolkata Knight Riders: 150 runs in 16.3 overs (100 balls), Extras 47th Wicket: 50 runs in 22 balls (RK Singh 10, AD Russell 38, Ex 2)AD Russell: 50 off 20 balls (2 x 4, 6 x 6)Kolkata Knight Riders: 200 runs in 18.6 overs (116 balls), Extras 8Innings Break: Kolkata Knight Riders - 208/7 in 20.0 overs (AD Russell 64, MA Starc 6)Sunrisers Hyderabad inningsPowerplay 1: Overs 0.1 - 6.0 (Mandatory - 65 runs, 1 wicket)Over 1.3: Review by Sunrisers Hyderabad (Batting), Decision Challenged - Wicket, Umpire - YC Barde, Batter - MA Agarwal (Upheld)Sunrisers Hyderabad: 50 runs in 4.3 overs (27 balls), Extras 51st Wicket: 50 runs in 27 balls (MA Agarwal 29, Abhishek Sharma 16, Ex 5)Strategic Timeout: Sunrisers Hyderabad - 65/1 in 6.0 overs (Abhishek Sharma 27, RA Tripathi 1)Sunrisers Hyderabad: 100 runs in 10.2 overs (62 balls), Extras 6Strategic Timeout: Sunrisers Hyderabad - 111/4 in 13.0 overs (H Klaasen 3, Abdul Samad 0)Over 12.6: Review by Kolkata Knight Riders (Bowling), Decision Challenged - Wicket, Umpire - R Pandit, Batter - Abdul Samad (Struck down - Umpires Call)Sunrisers Hyderabad: 150 runs in 17.1 overs (103 balls), Extras 6H Klaasen: 50 off 25 balls (7 x 6)6th Wicket: 50 runs in 13 balls (H Klaasen 34, Shahbaz Ahmed 16, Ex 1)Sunrisers Hyderabad: 200 runs in 19.1 overs (115 balls), Extras 7MATCH DETAILSEden Gardens, KolkataTossSunrisers Hyderabad, elected to field firstSeriesIndian Premier LeagueSeason2024Player Of The MatchAndre RussellHours of play (local time)19.30 start, First Session 19.30-21.00, Interval 21.00-21.20, Second Session 21.20-22.50Match days23 March 2024 - night (20-over match)SRH Player ReplacementImpact player: Abhishek Sharma in, T Natarajan out (1st innings, 19.6 ov)KKR Player ReplacementImpact player: Suyash Sharma in, Ramandeep Singh out (2nd innings, 7.6 ov)UmpiresRohan PanditDRSYeshwant BardeDRSTV UmpireBruce OxenfordReserve UmpireMohit KrishnadasMatch RefereeManu NayarPointsKolkata Knight Riders 2, Sunrisers Hyderabad 0LanguageEnglishWin ProbabilityKKR 100%KKRSRH100%50%100%KKR InningsSRH InningsOver 20 • SRH 204/7Shahbaz Ahmed c SS Iyer b Harshit Rana 16 (5b 1x4 2x6 15m) SR: 320WHeinrich Klaasen c Suyash Sharma b Harshit Rana 63 (29b 0x4 8x6 45m) SR: 217.24WKKR won by 4 runsPowered by Smart StatsMatch CoverageAll Match NewsVintage Dre Russ comes calling at Eden GardensAfter a quiet 2023 season, the allrounder began IPL 2024 with a bang, thumping an unbeaten 64 off 25 and picking up two wicketsShreyas on final over: Told Harshit this was his time to 'become a hero'Russell praises fast bowler for not shying away from the responsibility of bowling the last overRussell trumps Klaasen as KKR hold on for win Harshit Rana successfully defends 12 off the final over to hand the home side a thrilling four-run victory against SunrisersLive blog - KKR vs SRH, Harshit steals game away from SunrisersKKR host SRH as both teams kick off their IPL 2024 campaigns.

But the seamer followed it up with two singles, two wickets and one dot in the next five balls to seal the deal.Earlier, it was Sunil Narine's 1 for 19 in four overs on a batting-friendly surface - the spell included zero boundaries - which kept Sunrisers quiet through the middle overs. His economy of 4.75 was a complete outlier on a surface where bowlers, whether experienced or not, went for a lot. That had given KKR the upper hand with three overs to go, with Sunrisers needing 60 in 18 balls. But Klaasen's 29-ball 63, laced with eight sixes, dragged Sunrisers back into the contest.KKR also had Andre Russell, Phil Salt and Ramandeep Singh to thank for their first-innings score of 208. From 51 for 4, the hosts rebuilt courtesy Salt's 40-ball 54 on KKR debut and a 17-ball 35 from Ramandeep. Russell put the finishing touches to the KKR innings by smacking seven sixes in his 25-ball, unbeaten 64.Klaasen's near-heistThe last 18 months have belonged to Klaasen, who has turned into a rampaging spin-hitter to go with his strong range of shots against pace. He came in at No. 5 with Sunrisers needing 102 in 8.2 overs. Even though he started slowly, he found his range against Varun Chakravarthy, racing from six in seven balls to 18 off 12 with the help of two sixes in the 14th over.When Chakravarthy returned for the 18th and the target looking improbable, Klaasen again opened his shoulders by pummelling two more sixes. Then when Mitchell Starc, the most expensive player in IPL history, returned to close out the game in the 19th over, Klaasen clubbed him for three sixes in a 26-run over.With 47 runs scored in the 18th and 19th overs, Sunrisers had turned the game around. The 12-ball assault had sent ESPNcricinfo's forecaster swinging from being 99.27% in favour of KKR to putting Sunrisers at 81.95% favourites before the final over. However, Klaasen's dismissal at the hands of Harshit, one ball after smacking his eighth six, deflated Sunrisers and allowed KKR to close the game out.Heinrich Klaasen single-handedly took it deep for Sunrisers Hyderabad•BCCIRussell mauls Bhuvneshwar and CoWith just six overs to go in the first innings, KKR were 123 for 6 and still needed a glorious finish if they were to reach 200.After scoring two runs in his first five balls, Russell ruined Mayank Markande's bowling figures by muscling three sixes in the 16th over - two down the ground and one over midwicket - to race to 20 off 11.When Bhuvneshwar Kumar returned for his back-end spell, Russell made full use of a favourable match-up to maul the experienced pacer, hitting six and four in the 17th, with Rinku Singh adding another boundary in an 18-run over.The 18th bowled by T Natarajan also went for 15, and when Bhuvneshwar returned for the 19th, Russell clobbered him for four, six, six and four - using his power and the small boundaries to muscle 26 runs. In the process, he also hit his 200th six for KKR in franchise cricket and reached his fifty in 20 balls.That helped KKR touch 200 in 19 overs even as Rinku fell for a 13-ball 25 to become Natarajan's third scalp of the night. Russell finished unbeaten on 64 at a strike rate of 256 as Sunrisers conceded 85 runs in the last five overs to end up chasing an improbable 209.2:54Moody: Six-hitting machine Russell showed why he's paid the big bucksNarine stifles Sunrisers after powerplayTwin 32s at a rapid pace from openers Mayank Agarwal and Abhishek Sharma gave Sunrisers the kind of start they needed to chase down 209, a target that would've required the fourth-highest chase in IPL history. But both fell in the sixth and eighth overs to short balls from Harshit and Russell respectively. It was around that time, just after the powerplay had ended, that Shreyas Iyer went to Narine.Narine bowled consistently on a good length and found turn in both directions to keep Rahul Tripathi and Markram quiet. He conceded only two runs in his opening over and very nearly had Tripathi dismissed in his second when the batter mistimed a slog sweep. But a dropped chance from Chakravarthy gave Tripathi a second life.Tripathi would then receive a third life when Narine had him pinned in front of the stumps in the 11th over. But the umpire turned the appeal down and KKR did not review it.When Narine finally dismissed Tripathi in the 17th over, caught at deep square leg off the penultimate ball of his spell, he let out a roar, a rare display of emotion, as he earned just rewards for his impressive spell. Narine finished with eight dots bowled and zero boundaries conceded.Salt finds support in RamandeepThe KKR innings had begun disastrously when Narine - promoted to open again - fell cheaply to a run-out. Then Natarajan picked off Venkatesh Iyer (7) and Shreyas (0) in the same over to leave KKR 32 for 3.That forced Salt to rein his shot-making in, having initially started his innings with a hat-trick of sixes off Marco Jansen. The KKR batters, Salt included, struggled when Bhuvneshwar bowled in the fourth-stump channel in the powerplay, and by the eighth over they were 51 for 4 when Nitish Rana reverse swept Markande to backward point.But in No. 6 Ramandeep, Salt found a partner who could counterattack. Ramandeep was not intimidated by the short-ball barrage attempted by Sunrisers captain Pat Cummins or Marco Jansen. He pulled both bowlers for sixes in the ninth and 11th overs respectively and then began the 12th with an inside-out six off Shahbaz Ahmed. He was eventually caught at cover by a diving Markande off Cummins for a 17-ball 35 but by then he had ensured the KKR innings did not stagnate in the middle overs.Salt finally reached his third IPL fifty in the 14th over off Markande's bowling and looked disappointed when he fell for 54 in the same over. However, a KKR recovery from 51 for 4 to 119 for 6 in the space of 6.2 overs had given Rinku and Russell enough of a platform to capitalise on. And capitalise they did.Heinrich KlaasenHarshit RanaAndre RussellPhil SaltRamandeep SinghSunrisers HyderabadKolkata Knight RidersKKR vs SRHIndian Premier LeagueSreshth Shah is a sub-editor at ESPNcricinfo. @sreshthxLanguageEnglishWin ProbabilityKKR 100%KKRSRH100%50%100%KKR InningsSRH InningsOver 20 • SRH 204/7Shahbaz Ahmed c SS Iyer b Harshit Rana 16 (5b 1x4 2x6 15m) SR: 320WHeinrich Klaasen c Suyash Sharma b Harshit Rana 63 (29b 0x4 8x6 45m) SR: 217.24WKKR won by 4 runsPowered by Smart StatsMatch CoverageAll Match NewsVintage Dre Russ comes calling at Eden GardensAfter a quiet 2023 season, the allrounder began IPL 2024 with a bang, thumping an unbeaten 64 off 25 and picking up two wicketsShreyas on final over: Told Harshit this was his time to 'become a hero'Russell praises fast bowler for not shying away from the responsibility of bowling the last overRussell trumps Klaasen as KKR hold on for win Harshit Rana successfully defends 12 off the final over to hand the home side a thrilling four-run victory against SunrisersLive blog - KKR vs SRH, Harshit steals game away from SunrisersKKR host SRH as both teams kick off their IPL 2024 campaigns.

In what was typical modern hitting, Russell hammered 64* off 25 balls, and Klaasen hit back with 63 from 29. KKR were 51 for 4 at one stage, before going on to post 208; SRH required 60 in the last three overs, but fell just four short. Exceptional T20 batting from both sides! And with this thriller, we wrap the double-header Saturday up. Join us for another two games tomorrow, as this is Himanshu signing off on behalf of Raghav and Alan. Good night!Andre Russell is the Player of the Match: \"Sometimes I realise how I'm striking the ball... I just try to react to whatever comes my way. Over the last year or two, bowlers have been exceptionally good to me. I'm still figuring out how to score. I realise everyone is coming to me with a plan. I've been a permanent fixture in the XI [since making it there]. What I did tonight is just to say 'keep supporting'. I am happy to contribute with this jersey on. Harshit's body language was on point in the last over; he wanted the ball. If he was shying away from it, it could have gone their way. With the first ball gone for six, he still got the job done.\"Shreyas Iyer, KKR captain: \"Right from the 17th over I had butterflies in the stomach! To be honest, I thought anything can happen in the last over. Harshit was a bit nervous when he was coming to bowl [the last over]. I told him, 'Even if we lose, it's fine'. I tried to calm him down as much as possible. Narine and Russell have got such experience. Elated to see how Russell performed with bat and ball. Sunny executed well. It is a luxury to have them in the team. Whenever you start with a win, it gives you motivation. There are areas we need to improve on as a team - fielding is one of them!\"Time for the presentationsAfeef: \"This game boiled down to Russell vs Klaasen, the two most destructive batsmen from both the squads today\"Ramandeep Singh: \"I was really enjoying my time in the middle. Trying to play with intent. All thanks to Gauti paaji and Abhishek Nayar sir. I was striking pretty well in domestic cricket. The way these guys have backed me is tremendous. I really want to play like that (like Russell!). Maybe one day I will play like that! The plan was that Klaasen was really hitting the pace ball. So the message was to take pace off. I really loved the atmosphere at the ground.\"Pat Cummins, SRH captain: \"Close game in the end. Wonderful game of cricket; unfortunately didn't go our way. Dre Russ did what he does best. You do your planning, and you try to execute your plans. But he's a pretty tough guy to bowl to. Tough job in cricket to bowl to someone like him. It's one of those ones which goes one way or the other. Who would have thought we would have got that close? Unfortunately, a bit too much. Lots to be encouraged by. A couple of points to work on also.\"Joel Mick: \"There's something that even Cummins can't do!\"Karthik: \"Jailbreak :)\"11.25pm The heart rates rose and fell in the final over, which started with SRH requiring 13. The first ball went for six, and thereafter, it was all KKR, as Harshit got Shahbaz, who was playing second fiddle, and Klaasen, who threatened to do the impossible. Before the last over began, Klaasen and Shahbaz had pumped 63 off the three overs just before that. It seemed like KKR were running out of ideas, but just then, Harshit came out with his magical slower balls to deny a rampaging Klaasen, who continues his dream run in this part of the world. Hang around for the presentations.19.6•Harshit Rana to Cummins, no runsuperb final over! KKR can now breathe. He bowls another slower ball, and foxes Cummins too.

Someone listen to the deafening roar at Eden. Suyash, placed at short third, had to half-turn around while moving back and keeping his eyes on the ball.

Mohsin has shelled a few dollars but goes pace-on, into the pitch to hurry the in-form youngster. He went though with the shot but could only pop it straight to the man. The pitch has been on the slower side so far but this ball steered away from that trend.. 49/2See all photosNaveen-ul-Haq4041210.25841401.6 to JC Buttler, Nicked off on the flashing cover drive. Naveen is pumped! Excellent low catch from Rahul too. Was very full, there for the drive, but it's never as straightforward with Naveen's angles. Delivered from wide of the crease, it came in towards fifth stump, was coming back in. Buttler buckled his back knee and tried muscling it. The sound of the nick was like a stick breaking, it hovered low to Rahul's right. He was wrong-footed, as the first step was to the leg side, but he then flung himself low and timed the gather well.. 13/114.5 to R Parag, Tries doing something similar but holes out to deep-backward square. Was a shortish ball, 119ks, just outside off, Parag tried dragging it across with a pull, top edged it and Hooda took a dolly.

Think it was caught behind even though Rahul dislodged the stumps while lifting his hand in celebration. Length ball landed in line and turned away, the lid-less Hetmyer's front foot was well in front of the crease and he tried to defend with a straight bat. Hawk-Eye shows there was a feather, much to Hetmyer's surprise.

This is pretty much a gift from de Kock for Boult, who offers a wry smile. Boult bowled this on the fuller side of a length, angling it in and pitching outside leg. De Kock went clipping it with the line, only to find the fielder positioned bang where he hit it. Burger took it with a reverse cup to get into the action right away. 4/12.2 to D Padikkal, bowled him! This one keeps low after the previous one hammered his helmet. The ball hits the top of middle, and the stump is flattened. Boult went slightly on the shorter side of a length this time, while angling it into the left-hander. The ball pitched on or about off stump, and came back in while not entirely taking off from the pitch. Padikkal had shaped to swipe - perhaps seeing the length - and so it was too late by the time he tried to bend to keep that out. 10/2Nandre Burger3030110.00832003.1 to A Badoni, spooned to mid-off! Buttler sees the ball dying on to him, and takes a low catch. Burger leaving Royals' mouths spicy already. He bowled on a length, while shaping it across the right-hander and arriving outside off. Badoni went lofting seeing the length, but couldn't time his shot, and found the man inside the circle. 11/3See all photosRavichandran Ashwin403518.754111017.3 to MP Stoinis, finds Jurel at deep midwicket! Ashwin went with the carrom ball, on a length on middle and leg. Stoinis had his front leg out of the way, and went hammering for a big hit. But Jurel ended up grabbing another catch, as he came a few steps forward. 154/6Avesh Khan302107.0040110Yuzvendra Chahal302518.33602107.3 to DJ Hooda, nabbed at deep midwicket! Chahal strikes straight away. Jurel was actually placed a good few steps into the field of play, and had to take some steps back to gobble it in front of his stomach. Chahal tossed one up to invite Hooda, with the ball being fullish and outside off. Hooda skipped down and heaved, but it came off the inside half of the bat. 60/4Sandeep Sharma302217.336301016.1 to KL Rahul, taken at deep point! The pendulum swings late into the game. Sandeep bowls a wide line to Rahul, with the length being there to be hit. But Rahul went lofting far away from his body. Jurel had to take a few steps forward to catch that, and he did well in the end to send Rahul back. 145/5Unlocking the magic of StatsguruMATCH FLOWRajasthan Royals inningsPowerplay 1: Overs 0.1 - 6.0 (Mandatory - 54 runs, 2 wickets)Rajasthan Royals: 50 runs in 5.1 overs (31 balls), Extras 1Over 6.5: Review by Rajasthan Royals (Batting), Decision Challenged - Wide, Umpire - A Totre, Batter - SV Samson (Upheld)Strategic Timeout: Rajasthan Royals - 63/2 in 8.0 overs (SV Samson 21, R Parag 6)Rajasthan Royals: 100 runs in 10.4 overs (64 balls), Extras 23rd Wicket: 50 runs in 34 balls (SV Samson 28, R Parag 24, Ex 1)SV Samson: 50 off 33 balls (2 x 4, 4 x 6)Strategic Timeout: Rajasthan Royals - 142/3 in 14.5 overs (SV Samson 59)Rajasthan Royals: 150 runs in 16.1 overs (97 balls), Extras 5Over 16.3: Review by Rajasthan Royals (Batting), Decision Challenged - Wicket, Umpire - A Totre, Batter - SO Hetmyer (Struck down)Over 18.1: Review by Lucknow Super Giants (Bowling), Decision Challenged - Wide, Umpire - A Totre, Batter - DC Jurel (Struck down)Innings Break: Rajasthan Royals - 193/4 in 20.0 overs (SV Samson 82, DC Jurel 20)Lucknow Super Giants inningsPowerplay 1: Overs 0.1 - 6.0 (Mandatory - 47 runs, 3 wickets)Lucknow Super Giants Impact Player Sub: Deepak Hooda in for Yash Thakur (Lucknow Super Giants innings, 3.1 ov)Lucknow Super Giants: 50 runs in 6.3 overs (39 balls), Extras 9Strategic Timeout: Lucknow Super Giants - 57/3 in 7.0 overs (KL Rahul 17, DJ Hooda 26)Lucknow Super Giants: 100 runs in 11.4 overs (70 balls), Extras 105th Wicket: 50 runs in 30 balls (KL Rahul 27, N Pooran 22, Ex 1)KL Rahul: 50 off 35 balls (4 x 4, 2 x 6)Strategic Timeout: Lucknow Super Giants - 145/4 in 16.0 overs (KL Rahul 58, N Pooran 46)Lucknow Super Giants: 150 runs in 16.6 overs (102 balls), Extras 10N Pooran: 50 off 30 balls (2 x 4, 4 x 6)Over 18.0: Review by Rajasthan Royals (Bowling), Decision Challenged - Wide, Umpire - A Totre, Batter - N Pooran (Struck down)MATCH DETAILSSawai Mansingh Stadium, JaipurTossRajasthan Royals, elected to bat firstSeriesIndian Premier LeagueSeason2024Player Of The MatchSanju SamsonHours of play (local time)15.30 start, First Session 15.30-17.00, Interval 17.00-17.20, Second Session 17.20-18.50Match days24 March 2024 - daynight (20-over match)LSG Player ReplacementImpact player: Deepak Hooda in, Yash Thakur out (2nd innings, 3.1 ov)RR Player ReplacementImpact player: Nandre Burger in, Shimron Hetmyer out (1st innings, 19.6 ov)UmpiresAkshay TotreDRSKumar DharmasenaDRSTV UmpireKN AnanthapadmanabhanReserve UmpireVaibhav DhokreMatch RefereePrakash BhattPointsRajasthan Royals 2, Lucknow Super Giants 0LanguageEnglishWin ProbabilityRR 100%RRLSG100%50%100%RR InningsLSG InningsOver 20 • LSG 173/6RR won by 20 runsPowered by Smart StatsMatch CoverageAll Match NewsPowerplay swinger to death-overs specialist: the reinvention of Sandeep SharmaWith Trent Boult around, Sandeep has as all-new job description to meet at Rajasthan Royals.

Pooran finished unbeaten on 64 from 41 balls.Samson saves his best for firstSamson certainly knows how to launch an IPL campaign in style. For the fifth consecutive IPL campaign, dating back to 2020, he opened Royals' account with a half-century, this time in an innings featuring three fours and six sixes, the best of which - from the penultimate ball of the innings - was a formidable inside-out drill over extra cover from Mohsin Khan.The bulk of Samson's work was done in the course of a 93-run stand with Riyan Parag, that spanned 62 balls and bridged a potentially tricky period at the end of the powerplay, in which Jos Buttler's streaky 11 from nine balls, and Yashasvi Jaiswal's more focussed cameo of 24 from 12, had telegraphed a potentially tricky pitch for comfortable strokeplay.Sanju Samson's 82 powered Rajasthan Royals to a strong total•BCCICertainly, LSG's spinners found some purchase on the cracked, dry surface. Krunal Pandya, on his 33rd birthday, wheeled through his four boundary-less overs for 19, and could have dismissed Parag for a golden duck when he induced a leading edge back down the pitch, only for Samson at the non-striker's end to get in the way, completely inadvertently, as he stood his ground with the ball lobbing towards his helmet.Both men, however, stepped up their intensity after the strategic time-out, when the extra pace of Yash Thakur entered the fray. Three sixes poured forth in a 21-run over, including back-to-back pulls from Samson off undercooked bouncers, and after bringing up Royals' 100 with another six off Ravi Bishnoi in the 11th over, Samson marched onto his fifty from 33 balls - by which stage Parag should have been removed for 29, only for Mohsin at square leg to make a hash of a top-edged sweep.Lightning Boult strikes twiceBoult and first-over wickets are a staple of the IPL experience. This time, it was Quinton de Kock in his sights at the top of the powerplay, his 24th such victim - second only to Bhuvneshwar Kumar's 27 - and it set in motion a catastrophic top-order implosion for LSG.De Kock's only scoring shot was a classy punch down the ground to a full-length outswinger, but when Boult fired one into his legs in the same over, he lured a loose flick in the air to Burger at backward fine leg.Two balls into his second, Boult struck again, delivering a merciless one-two to Devdutt Padikkal, to ensure his reunion with his former Royals team-mates was a miserable one. A sharp bouncer pinged Padikkal's helmet and sent his neck-guard spinning; Boult's follow-up skidded through low and pegged back his middle and leg stumps as he flapped loosely across the line from deep in the crease.And LSG reached their nadir one ball into the fourth over, as Burger - the most literal impact sub imaginable - fired down a 147kph delivery that Ayush Badoni could only spoon to Buttler at mid-off. At 11 for 3, the fightback would have to be a remarkable one.KL Rahul's 58 off 44 balls was in vain•BCCIRahul's role in the spotlightIt's a tricky time for Rahul across formats. In the absence of Virat Kohli, he had looked set to be the wise old head in India's Test team, until his untimely injury against England opened the door for the same generation of young guns who are pushing him to the fringes in the white-ball set-up too.And so, his innings of 58 from 44 balls was an important reminder of his enduring class, albeit his dismissal at the start of the 17th over, caught at deep cover moments after the strategic time-out, effectively spelt the end of LSG's challenge, with first Marcus Stoinis and then Pandya unable to find their timing from the get-go. The fact that he took the gloves, ahead of both Quinton de Kock and Pooran, was arguably a sign of his desire to remind the India selectors of his enduring versatility.Either way, while it lasted, Rahul's knock provided, first, the stability his team so desperately needed, and latterly the power to stay in touch with a run rate that was pushing two a ball by the tenth over. His own contribution at that point had been a run-a-ball 26, but in crashing the dangerous Burger for 6, 4, 4 from his next three deliveries, he rushed towards a 35-ball fifty, and signalled a charge that would not fizzle until his departure.Deepak Hooda, LSG's impact sub, has come and gone with a degree of purpose too, making 26 from 13 balls before taking on Yuzvendra Chahal, into the breeze, and holing out at deep midwicket. But it took Pooran's more focussed power to truly ignite his team's belief.At 102 for 4 in the 12th over, Boult returned for his final over as Royals strove for the partnership-breaking wicket. Pooran was waiting to take him down in a 20-run over that finished with a low full-toss being smashed over wide long-on for six.Sandeep, however, was still lurking up Samson's sleeve, and his introduction proved pivotal. His first over, in the 15th of the innings, stemmed the flow of boundaries with just five singles, one of which could have been a direct-hit run-out. And when, in his second, Rahul chased his wide line to pick out Dhruv Jurel in the deep, Royals had seized back control.Sanju SamsonKL RahulNicholas PooranRiyan ParagLucknow Super GiantsRajasthan RoyalsRR vs LSGIndian Premier LeagueAndrew Miller is UK editor of ESPNcricinfo. @miller_cricketLanguageEnglishWin ProbabilityRR 100%RRLSG100%50%100%RR InningsLSG InningsOver 20 • LSG 173/6RR won by 20 runsPowered by Smart StatsMatch CoverageAll Match NewsPowerplay swinger to death-overs specialist: the reinvention of Sandeep SharmaWith Trent Boult around, Sandeep has as all-new job description to meet at Rajasthan Royals.

But the action shifts to Ahmedabad, where Pandya's GT host Pandya's MI. That is it from us from Jaipur this evening, as this is Himanshu signing off on behalf of Raghav, Thilak and Ekanth! Good night!Sanju Samson is the Player of the Match for his 82*: \"It's always great fun to spend time in the middle. This time I have been a different role, with a slightly different combination. Sanga has given me suggestions... I have been playing IPL for ten years, so there's experience coming in. Good start, but let's see how it goes. It's all about understanding your strengths and weakness. I just react to the ball. That helps me maintain the shape. I think I should give the trophy to Sandeep Sharma. I wouldn't have been standing here [but for him]... I thought of calling him, but then thought it would be a bit too much! Everyone chipped in well. We just had to stick to our plans.\"Time for the presentations\"Looks like Ashwin gave a coach's talk\" --- He loves it, KumarS!R Ashwin: \"It was a wicket of two halves. When we batted first, it stuck in the pitch. Sometimes it is tough... After the eight-over mark, we felt the wicket was a good one. In our view, we were ten short. It was a good pitch; it tends to get better here. I went for 12 off the first ball I bowled! I bowl in different stages of the game. The body is ageing. Requires different mindset. I came from a Test series. I went for 15 in the first over - that was inside the powerplay. The moment that phase of the game is done, I try to shell it away. The next three overs of mine went for 20, and I got a wicket... Most importantly, [it is about] preparing for every single batter in the opposition. The game is built by perception. Sandeep has been an unsung hero. He stepped up for Prasidh last year. He is a character; it's about the fight they have. A bowler for a fight is way more valuable than a bowler with a skill. There are two bouncers to be used, and that's the only fillip the bowlers have got in this competition. Boulty's very aggressive up front, and so is Nandre.\"KL Rahul, LSG captain: \"I don't think the target was a lot; it was just ten over-par. We bowled well in patches. Not making too much out of it. Just made a few mistakes. Mohsin was our powerplay bowler in the first season, but he wasn't fully fit last season. Good to see him back. Naveen has been crucial for us since he has come in. Powerplay is crucial for every team, and I don't think any team has cracked it yet. We'll made from the small mistakes we made. When we are three [down] for nothing, and we give ourselves a chance of chasing 194 speaks of our line-up... We need to find ways to win games of cricket. We'll try to build from here, and see where we can get stronger. Langer's brought a lot of calmness to the group. I stole his line when I said we need to find ways to win games of cricket. We enjoy having him around. All of us have watched him coach Australia to a T20 World Cup and an Ashes victory. When you get runs, you always feel good. But it's important for us to end up on the winning side. That gives more satisfaction. Missing a season was really painful.\"7.23pm LSG needed another 49 from the last 24 balls, with Rahul and Pooran well set and ready to smash. That is when Sandeep Sharma struck, and pushed LSG back against the wall. His first over had gone for only five, and he started the death overs with Rahul's wicket. Rahul took his time to score 58, and eventually, it was too much to do for even Pooran, who was much brighter with 64* in 41 balls. RR seemed to have lost their way after they had LSG at 11 for 3 and then 60 for 4, but Sandeep, who finished with 1 for 22 in three overs, was spot on when required.

Full outside off and angling in. Rohit can't connect. Big appeal and given immediately. Rohit reviews it. Was impact outside off? Impact in front of off and that's shown to be crashing into middle stump. No fifty for Rohit Sharma, but a very good knock nonetheless.

Tilak flicks it straight to deep backward square! Spencer Johnson is pumped. Sub fielder Abhinav Manohar is pumped. This was full and angling into Tilak who moved across as he looked to flick it, but he can't get the elevation or the placement. Hit straight to the fielder. First IPL wicket for Spencer Johnson!. 148/618.6 to G Coetzee, Top edge and it's taken! Bouncer on middle at 137kph, Coetzee miscues the pull and it goes high in the air.

The captain. With Mumbai Indians on 107 for 2 after 12 overs, chasing 169, he barracked his team to get back in the game. And boy, did they ever.A batting line-up that is the envy of the T20 world came undone even with conditions pretty much in their favour, with two set batters at the crease and dew all over the park. And Titans, who had less than 8% chance of victory, went on to achieve a famous one. Or maybe it isn't. Because they keep doing this. They keep defying the odds.Here they had their former captain - the one who built them into IPL winners - give them a huge scare. Hardik Pandya went 6 and 4 to start the last over when 19 were required. He looked in the mood. His old coach Ashish Nehra, who spent a vast majority of the chase patrolling the boundary, issuing instructions - seemingly spoon-feeding Spencer Johnson what he had to do in a 19th over that produced two of the five wickets that fell in the last 13 balls - turned away. He couldn't watch.But he should have. Because Umesh Yadav, who doesn't really bowl at the death, took full advantage of the two-bouncers-an-over rule and sent one up at Hardik's right ear, which, even with his power, only went as far as the fielder at long-on. Eighty thousand and eighty one people roared in unison. They sensed it. They sensed that yet another incredible win was theirs.Pace off, game onThis game turned between overs 13 and 17 in the chase. Because only one of them yielded more than a-run-a-ball.R Sai Kishore, who doesn't always make the Titans XI but has never come across like he's been on the outside looking in, produced a very mature performance. He took out Rohit Sharma with some style, slowing his pace right down, pulling his length right back, and having an excellent player of spin so badly reaching for the ball that he fell over in his crease as he played the sweep.Sai Kishore picked up the all-important wicket of Rohit Sharma•BCCIRashid Khan took over from there on and created a moment that signalled the shifting of the balance. Mumbai's best power-hitter, Tim David, was hidden from the strike because he has been averaging 7.6 against legspin since IPL 2022. This was the 17th over and the required rate was still in the eight-and-a-bit range. The batting side had six wickets in hand. They really shouldn't have been under pressure with an equation like that.But they were and the wickets as a result of that pressure went to Mohit Sharma, who is a wonderful case study because his biggest strength goes against his job description. The fast bowler who is far more dangerous when he bowls his slower ball. That came in very handy on a two-paced pitch. He dismissed David with an offcutter-boucner that rose up to the batter's helmet and took away all his power.A Titans comeback, which only ever looked fanciful till then, became reality.The story of the first inningsThe Titans innings was a bit staccato. Five of their 20 overs produced five or fewer runs. Four others produced 60 - including 30 back-to-back from the 10th and 11th - and 19 from the 18th over where Luke Wood lost his plans. The field was set for the slower ball, his slower ball went for six, he went for pace, and it was too easy for Rahul Tewatia with third in the circle. A two-paced pitch - which kept low too at times - was creating this kind of game.Gill made a fast start (31 off 22) and Sai Sudharsan (45 off 39) kept away the doubt that fills a batter's mind when very few of the shots they play go for boundaries. He hit only four and his strike rate was 115 but in between innings he mentioned that the ball was holding up in the pitch and keeping low as well, and that they weren't too displeased with the total they had got to.Bumrah magic in vainJasprit Bumrah bowled only one of the first six overs and perhaps that's why they yielded 47 runs. He struck with a glorious yorker thudding into the base of Wriddhiman Saha's middle stump. This was vintage from perhaps the best cricketer on the planet right now. The most inimitable one anyway.Jasprit Bumrah's double-wicket 17th over put the brakes on Gujarat Titans' scoring•BCCIBumrah's dismissal of David Miller contained even more of his genius. He has that awkward action. He has unbelievable pace (for a guy who basically walks for about half his run-up). He has the best yorker in the business. The batter has all this in mind when he takes strike. And is completely unprepared for the slower ball.Miller was done. He was cooked. His body moving one way - because his feet were stuck on the crease, worried about the high-pace ball, maybe the yorker - and his bat moving the other - responding to the utter lack of pace, wandering so far in front of his body - his balance lost to the night. And so too his wicket.Bumrah finished with figures of 4-0-14-3. All of them were one over spells. He was given no opportunity to build rhythm because he can be peak right from the get-go. It was unthinkable at that point that he'd also be needed out there with bat, but you always run the risk of that when you play Titans.Gujarat TitansMumbai IndiansGT vs MIIndian Premier LeagueAlagappan Muthu is a sub-editor at ESPNcricinfoLanguageEnglishWin ProbabilityGT 100%GTMI100%50%100%GT InningsMI InningsOver 20 • MI 162/9Hardik Pandya c Tewatia b Yadav 11 (4b 1x4 1x6 9m) SR: 275WPiyush Chawla c Rashid Khan b Yadav 0 (1b 0x4 0x6 1m) SR: 0WGT won by 6 runsPowered by Smart StatsMatch CoverageAll Match NewsSai Kishore: 'We felt we were 10 short' but 'competed really well'The left-arm spinner is relishing his role in the Titans attack, and the prospect of batters playing out Rashid Khan and coming after himAhmedabad shows its feelings in Hardik's night of agonyIf you needed a reminder of how deep fan loyalty can run in the IPL, this was itGill praises 'outstanding' bowling after stunning comeback against MumbaiMumbai Indians needed only 48 runs off six overs with seven wickets in hand, and they fell shortWho is Naman Dhir, Mumbai's new No. 3?He had played just four T20 innings before this and is the latest unknown entity from MI's scouting stableTitans pull off heist against former captain Hardik Pandya's MumbaiIt was another famous Gujarat Titans victory, in front of a home crowd of over eighty thousandInstant answers to T20 questionsAsk a questionVideosAll Match Videos2:15Pollard: Hardik ahead of Bumrah with new ball to 'use the swing'MI InningsPLAYER NAMERBIshan Kishancaught04RG Sharmalbw4329Naman Dhirlbw2010D Breviscaught4638NT Tilak Varmacaught2519TH Davidcaught1110HH Pandyacaught114G Coetzeecaught13SZ Mulaninot out11PP Chawlacaught01JJ Bumrahnot out11Extras(w 3)Total162(9 wkts; 20 ovs)PLAYER NAMEOMRWEconAzmatullah Omarzai302729 UT Yadav3031210.33 Rashid Khan402305.75 R Sai Kishore402416 SH Johnson2025212.5 MM Sharma403228 WKTRUNSPLAYERS1st0Rohit SharmaIshan Kishan2nd30Rohit SharmaNaman Dhir3rd77Rohit SharmaDewald Brevis4th22Dewald BrevisTilak Varma5th13Tim DavidTilak Varma6th6Hardik PandyaTilak Varma7th2Gerald CoetzeeHardik Pandya8th10Hardik PandyaShams Mulani9th0Piyush ChawlaShams Mulani10th2Jasprit BumrahShams Mulani<1 / 3>Indian Premier LeagueTEAMMWLPTNRRKKR1183161.453RR1082160.622CSK1165120.700SRH1064120.072LSG116512-0.371DC115610-0.442RCB11478-0.049PBKS11478-0.187GT11478-1.320MI11386-0.356Full TableTerms of Use|Privacy Policy|Your US State Privacy Rights|Children's Online Privacy Policy|Interest - Based Ads|Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information|Feedback© 2024 ESPN Sports Media Ltd.

Jasprit Bumrah, back and fit and firing for MI, bowled a brilliant spell, finishing with three for 14. Rohit Sharma and Dewald Brevis got to the forties. But it's a complete team effort from Gujarat Titans that eventually comes out trumps. It was another closely-fought contest with the home team coming out on top, which has been the trend for all five games this season. That will be all from us. On behalf of Sreshth, Thilak and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo, it's Abhimanyu signing off.11.3pm Stay tuned for the presentation ceremony.Gujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill: \"I think the way the boys held their nerves, and the way we bowled in the death overs, especially with the dew coming in, I thought it was special. With the dew, how the spinners bowled, they made sure we stayed in the game. It was all about putting on the pressure [on the batters]. [Mohit] has been a revelation for us since he joined us last year and hopefully he can continue his form. We just wanted them to feel under pressure. The plan was to keep building the pressure and wait for them to make a mistake. [On their total] I thought 170 was a good score but we definitely left 10-15 runs out there. Even with them, they were scoring above par but with the old ball and the pitch being slow, it's difficult to hit.\"Player of the match, Sai Sudharsan: \"Even in the first innings it was a little bit difficult. Dew helped them go after the bowlers but I think we pulled off a great game today. I'm not taking it as pressure, I'm just taking it as an opportunity to express myself and help my team win. After a few balls I felt it's not that kind of a wicket where you go after the ball every over. So i felt building the game was more important. I was actually a bit shocked for getting the player of the match because there were many great contributions [from the bowlers]. [On bowling plans] Taking the pace off was the plan. Even I found it difficult.\"Hardik Pandya: \"Obviously we back ourselves to chase those 42 runs [in the last five overs] but it was one of those days where we see the score quite less in those last five overs, we lost a bit of momentum there. It feels good to be back because this is one stadium where you can enjoy and feel the atmosphere quite lively and obviously the crowd was full and they got a good game as well. [On Tilak turning down the single to David] I think Tilak felt that was a better idea at that point of time. I completely back him. Not an issue, 13 games to go.\"Debutant Spencer Johnson: \"Absolutely incredible [experience]. Full house here. To get the win is very special. [On the 19th over] I think to stay calm. I had Ash [Nehra] telling me you're going to win the game. To have the backing from him and everyone else, even after going for runs in my first over, it's pretty cool. For me what works well is bowling hard lengths and keeping calm and not panicking and sticking to doing what I do well. This is easily the biggest crowd I've played in front of. I've always wanted to play cricket in india and here I am. I hope we can keep winning. Shubman is unbelievable. He sat next to me on the bus trip. He was calming me. We talked through the game. As a young captain, he's unbelievable.\"Roopang : \"Difference between two team is Nehraji\"Rajesh: \"While everybody plays cricket, Nehra plays football. Always outside the line, passing tips ball by ball! Have not seen other coaching staff do this. Kudos!\"Ahmed: \"The whole GT bowling unit is POTM in my opinion!\" Indeed! it was a fantastic team effort to choke Mumbai Indians the moment they slowed down a little. Saw an opportunity and grabbed it.11.25pm What a brilliant comeback from the Titans after Mumbai Indians looked like they were cruising to victory! Sai Kishore bowled beautifully, Rashid Khan was wicketless but economical. But Mohit Sharma with a two-wicket over changed things around before Spencer Johnson responded to an expensive first over in the IPL with two big wickets in the 19th over. The stage was set for Hardik Pandya to take his new team to victory over his old and he started the final over with a six and a four but the experienced Umesh Yadav came out on top eventually. Shubman Gill starts off his first captaincy assignment with a win over his old captain!Afeef: \"Got to commend the GT bowlers and new captain Gill for how they choked MI.\"19.61Umesh Yadav to Mulani, 1 runTop edge falls short of long leg, but it doesn't matter.

Great comeback for Siraj. Bairstow swipes at a length ball. The bat turns in his hand as he hits it and it goes up. Kohli settles under it coming in from cover and takes it with no fuss. 17/118.4 to JM Sharma, Short ball does the trick again! Second bouncer of the over, outside off. Jitesh looks to slap it on the off side but it goes high in the air. Anuj Rawat has been excellent with the gloves today and again, he makes no mistake. But wait! They are checking if it hit the Spider-Cam! But no reprieve for Jitesh after a check by the umpire. Seems to not have had any contact with the camera or the wires. 154/6See all photosYash Dayal402315.7513302017.5 to SM Curran, What a brilliant catch! Take a bow, Anuj Rawat! Dayal directs a bouncer at Curran, who looks to pull but was cramped for room. Ends up gloving it. Rawat sticks his right arm up as he jumps in the air and plucks it out of the air. And that will be all for Sam Curran today. A few boundaries this over, but overall a fantastic spell from Yash Dayal. And he has another delivery to go!. 150/5See all photosAlzarri Joseph4043110.758422011.6 to LS Livingstone, Joseph gets the big wicket of Livingstone!

Dhawan holes out to long-off and RCB players are absolutely pumped! This is tossed up outside off and spinning away from Dhawan as he looks to go inside out.

Given too, Rawat reviews. Offcutter at 108ks, was the turn taking it too far? Impact seems to have been on middle and leg. Rawat was on the front foot and got hit under the knee roll after being beaten on the flick. Dhawan has a word with Curran while Hawk-Eye loads. That might not have been a cutter, almost looks like a back of handed. Chetan, our scorer, says it might be a googly. What does it say now? Clipping leg stump, decision stands.. 130/6See all photosArshdeep Singh3.2040012.0095230Kagiso Rabada402325.751330102.4 to F du Plessis, Skied to mid-on, Rabada gets his former skipper. Full ball at 137ks at the stumps, Faf tried getting under it and launching it down the ground, got it off the bottom edge. The open stance doesn't help as he can't transfer the weight forward. He knew he was gone right away. Easy enough catch for Curran, who is pumped. 26/14.4 to C Green, Appeal for caught behind, there's a small chat about whether the was catch. Looked like the umpire raised his finger but it is actually sent upstairs. Jitesh dove to the right and took it low, ball went straight in the gloves. Was a wide 137ks length ball that was around the offside tramline. Green tried heaving it square on the offside but even his reach wasn't enough. 43/2See all photosHarpreet Brar401323.2512000010.3 to RM Patidar, Darted into middle, beats Patidar's attempted hoick over midwicket! Length ball, coming in with the angle, was an arm ball. Pace in the late 90ks. Patidar couldn't shift gears after being promoted.. 86/312.1 to GJ Maxwell, Maxwell makes room and chops it on! This is why fingerspinners bowl stump to stump in T20s. Maxwell made room to open up the offside but underedged onto ground and back on to middle. 90ks. Like after the last wicket, Harpreet has a thigh-five and spreads his arms wide. 103/4See all photosHarshal Patel4045111.256423015.6 to V Kohli, Slashed, taken at wide third! That is field placement at its best! Harpreet was somewhere between deep third and deep-backward point and got a low catch in front. Kohli made room and tried to lift the 135ks full ball, couldn't get the placement right or the power to clear the man. He leans on his bat in disappointment.

A last-over thriller. An RCB win.Everything that Royal Challengers Bengaluru fans would have wanted from their team's first home game of the season, they got it. In spades. But, it didn't come without a scare.For the longest time, Kohli - the king of the chase - had things under control. Chasing 177, he had the crowd dancing to his tune as he smashed the Punjab Kings bowlers all around the park for a 49-ball 77.Till he didn't.Harpreet Brar's frugal spell of 2 for 13 after Kagiso Rabada's two-wicket burst in the powerplay had RCB in a bind. The crowd was silenced. Were RCB going to become the first team this IPL to lose a home game?Enter finisher Dinesh Karthik.His bio says he is 38. He is! But you wouldn't believe that seeing him move around the crease, and up and down the pitch. With RCB requiring 47 off 22, Karthik walked in and smoked an unbeaten 28 off ten balls, with three fours and two sixes, to take RCB over the line with four balls to spare.Virat Kohli did the early scoring in RCB's chase and ended with a 49-ball 77•BCCIA Kohli special for the Chinnaswamy to rememberBut, it so nearly wasn't.Striding out to bat with a vociferous crowd behind him, Kohli took strike. Sam Curran got the ball to tail away from him first ball. It took a thick edge and went to short third. The next ball, Curran went closer, inviting a drive. Kohli took the bait and got a thick edge but the ball went too fast for Bairstow to react at first slip and burst through his hands. That was just the luck Kohli needed. He drove Curran through the covers next ball, then clipped him past short fine-leg, before creaming a half-volley through the covers to make it 16 runs off the first over.Rabada then came on but Kohli was in no mood to show any respect, haring down the track and slamming him over cover. Kohli then took on Arshdeep Singh, thumping him for three fours in an over to race to 33 off 15 balls, the most runs he has scored in the first 15 balls ever in a T20 innings. Eight fours in his first 15 balls. Kohli was away, RCB were away.Harpreet Brar bowled brilliantly, keeping RCB quiet and picking up wickets at the same time•Associated PressRCB slow down, courtesy Brar and RabadaRabada got among the wickets first. He accounted for Faf du Plessis - the third time in three IPL innings - and then had Cameron Green edging behind with Jitesh Sharma taking a good low catch.The real squeeze, though, was applied by Harpreet Brar and he did it with his length.Four overs, 13 runs, two wickets and that's while Kohli was on a rampage.Sixteen of the 24 balls Brar bowled were on a length. From quite high up. He kept the speed on the quicker side, and more importantly, didn't give the batters a chance to get under the ball. Both his wickets came off balls bowled at a length.Rajat Patidar, frustrated at not getting anything away, went back to a flatter delivery looking for a hoick to the leg side, but missed and looked back to see his stumps in a mess. Glenn Maxwell then tried to open the off side up but was undone by an arm ball, and could only get an under-edge back on to his stumps. Brar did not concede a single boundary in his four-over spell. In fact, he only went for one double. The rest of it was all singles.Dinesh Karthik lived up to his billing as a cool finisher•BCCIThe scare and the finishKohli, meanwhile, reached his 100th 50-plus score in T20 cricket. But the required rate was soaring. He got two fours away off Harshal but fell soon after with his slash reaching only as far as deep third. Anuj Rawat fell two balls later and the equation suddenly seemed to be going out of hand for RCB.Karthik, though, found an ally in Mahipal Lomror, the impact sub. Lomror clipped Curran past short fine-leg for four first ball and then slammed Arshdeep for a six and four next over. Karthik took over after that as Harshal Patel leaked 13 off the penultimate over. With ten to win in the final over, Karthik brought out the scoop first ball against Arshdeep for six. A wide followed, before Karthik aced the chase with a hit over the bowler's head.The Chinnaswamy went delirious, and so did the RCB changeroom.But there were big performances in the first half of the match too.1:29Yash Dayal was 'absolutely phenomenal' in powerplay - McClenaghanYash Dayal puts the brakes on in the powerplayBefore Monday, Yash Dayal had played only one game at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in his T20 career. That was last season against RCB when he was with Gujarat Titans. He didn't have the best of times finishing with 1 for 39 off his four overs.But on the day, or night, Dayal was on the money.He bowled three overs in the powerplay and went for just ten runs, conceding only one four.Mohammed Siraj was picked up for a four first ball of the innings, and then conceded two more against Jonny Bairstow, but he had the last laugh. Bairstow took a swipe at a length ball, only to get a top-edge that ballooned straight up.Dayal kept things tight at the other end, even if he didn't get wickets.It was that Test-match length that did the job for him. He kept the ball short of a good length 12 out of 18 times in the first six overs, and went for just four runs with those. There was not a lot of swing on offer, but he made sure to keep the ball as close to the batter, and found just a hint of movement, not giving room to the batters to swing. The Kings batters could only manage 40 for 1 in the first six overs.1:07'Punjab Kings' tactics an absolute disaster'RCB chip away with the ballNone of the Kings batters were able to convert their starts into anything substantial. Shikhar Dhawan scored 45 but took 37 balls for it. Prabhsimran Singh got 25, Jitesh 27, Liam Livingstone 17. And that hurt them as RCB kept chipping away.Maxwell picked up two wickets in the middle over, while Siraj also got two and it seemed Kings would fall well short of a par score, which is quite high at the venue. But Shashank Singh clobbered Alzarri Joseph for two sixes and a four in the last over to take Kings to a respectable total, even if it seemed a bit below par at the halfway stage. And that's how it turned out to be.Virat KohliHarpreet BrarKagiso RabadaDinesh KarthikGlenn MaxwellMohammed SirajShikhar DhawanShashank SinghPunjab KingsRoyal Challengers BengaluruPBKS vs RCBIndian Premier LeagueAshish Pant is a sub-editor with ESPNcricinfoLanguageEnglishWin ProbabilityRCB 100%PBKSRCB100%50%100%PBKS InningsRCB InningsOver 20 • RCB 178/6RCB won by 4 wickets (with 4 balls remaining)Powered by Smart StatsMatch CoverageAll Match NewsKohli shows he has 'still got it' in T20s with an innings like no otherIn his second game after a two-month break, Kohli serves a reminder with an explosive innings at ChinnaswamyKohli on his two-month break from cricket: 'A surreal experience not to be recognised'\"Just the ability to be together, the connections that you make with your older child, it's amazing.\"The Kohli & Karthik show takes RCB over the line against spirited Punjab KingsBowlers from both sides put up a big show at a traditionally high-scoring venue, but the class and experience of Kohli and Karthik sealed the deal in the endLive Blog - Royal Challengers Bengaluru vs Punjab Kings - Kohli, Karthik star as RCB score first winRCB host Punjab Kings in Bengaluru.

There were unforced errors, teams not capitalising after getting close to taking home the advantage. Kohli's intent™️ chat won't be too loud given how he exploded at the start. But both teams got a lot of things right tactically and skill-wise, which made it a great game for the neutrals too. Hope that trend continues as the tournament progresses and that you follow it along with us, here on Cricinfo.Harit Gautam: \"\"We had to pay the price for dropping Kohli\" hope the selectors don't have to repeat Dhawan's words after the World Cup \"Kozhakks: \"Loved the post match presentation from Kohli! The camaraderie between Harsha and Kohli was evident in that. \"[Dancing down and hitting over cover to pacers] I had to, bowlers know I play the cover drive pretty well. So they won't allow me to hit gaps. Guys like KG and Arshdeep, if they are hitting length, you have to create momentum, once you're closer to the ball you negate the bounce. You have to come up with a game plan and try to keep improving. I know my name is often used to just promote the T20 game across the world these days but still got it I guess. [Last two months] We were not in the country. We were at a place where people weren't recognizing us. Just to feel normal for two months was a surreal experience. Of course, things become totally different with two kids from a family perspective. Just being together, the connection with the older kid too is amazing. I couldn't have been more grateful to God for the opportunity that I got to spend time with the family. I was telling the guys that the voices got that much louder as it wasn't the case for the last two months. It was amazing to be another person on the road. I don't play for caps, it's just another opportunity. (2/2)Virat Kohli, POTM: [To the crowd] Don't get overexcited, it's just two games. I know what this (orange cap) means. [Love story with the crowd] It's been going on for years. People talk a lot about playing the sport. At the end of the day you don't talk about the achievements, stats or numbers but the memories. It's what Rahul Dravid says. The friendship, love, appreciation, backing has been amazing and is what you'll miss and never forget. In T20, I'm opening, I try to give the team a blazing start. But when wickets start falling, you have to understand the conditions as well. The wicket wasn't as placid as normal here. It was a bit two-paced. Had to play correct cricketing shots, couldn't hit balls across the line. Tried a few, felt like I needed big hits at the other end, which didn't happen as Maxi and Anuj got out quickly. Disappointed not having finished it off. It was a slot ball that I sliced straight to deep point. Not a bad bad though playing after two months and getting into the tournament. (1/2)Faf du Plessis, RCB captain: [Was he cool] Only on the outside, not as much on the inside. Gotta make sure you get over the line early in the tournament. Great to see the composure at the end. Don't think game was gone after Kohli went, because of the Impact Player and Mahipal in. In previous years we used to feel 12 runs in the last overs would be tough but now even 15s seem gettable in the last two. Really pleased for DK getting his game going. It sets us up for the rest of the tournament. Games get won at lost at the No. 7 and 8 position with the Impact subs, so he's key. Our plan at the auction was to find the DNA of the team. It's tough on this unique ground. The pitch was a bit different. Kohli's is still the same person, has had a nice break. It helps keep fresh in the back end of the career.Dinesh Karthik Getting there [past the rust] I wasn't completely in control but it started to feel good. We needed the partnership with Lomror, he took the pressure off me with that six. It was critical, he batted well. Harshal is a wily customer. If you miss the dipping slower ball, you're done, so I had to time the scoop well. Lomror looked calm, didn't tell him anything at first. Told him to put that behind after he hit that six, then keep his head still and the rest will follow through. He's been batting well in the nets too.Shikhar Dhawan, Punjab Kings captain: Good game, we brought it back. Think we were 10-15 less. Should have encashed in the first six overs. We had to pay the price for dropping Kohli. We lost momentum there, it was crucial. It looked a good wicket but wasn't true. It was stopping, bit of double-bounce and turned. 70% it was coming good. I was happy with my runs but think could've played faster in the first six. We lost two wickets which put pressure too. That total we thought was par. Match went till last over, at the end we could have bowled better. Harpreet is bowling really well, that too to left-handers on a small ground. He soaked in pressure and got breakthroughs. His celebration, the Kabaddi thing, is big in Punjab. People connect with the thigh-five, happy to see him doing it11:14pm It was a twist-y turn-y chase. Kings were in it despite the unforced error. But Kohli gave RCB liftoff and DK landed the plane safely. All games this season have been won by the home team. RCB's record hasn't been great but that wasn't an issue tonight. The biggest event seemed to have taken place at the start of the chase, when Bairstow dropped Kohli. It unleashed one of the best players, and indeed flayers, in cricket. Him charging pacers and clubbing them through extra is what we've imagined doing as kids. The overseas stars failed. Promoting Green to No. 3 and Patidar over Maxwell didn't work. Harpreet was sensational, Rabada was good too. The constant wickets almost derailed the chase, especially Kohli fell due to some smart field placement. But DK came in with ice in the veins, got Lomror for support and the duo cleared the game with great skill and calmness.Raab: \"As a Bangladeshi, just had PTSD watching DK bat like this. If you know, you know. \"19.24Arshdeep Singh to Karthik, FOUR runsDrilled down the ground, DK's reviving himself and takes RCB to a win in their first home game.

His reaction and Saha's reaction seems to suggest so. Oh, yeah, he is gone. Was a quicker length ball on leg stump, he gets a thick inside edge through his leg. Don't think Rachin knew how far or where exactly the ball went and ventured out of his crease. Saha was quick to whip off the bails to finds Rachin short. 62/118.2 to S Dube, Mistimed and Rashid gets his man! Googly right across Dube and away from his arc outside off. Was at the tramline. Dube looks to go after him, gets it right of the bottom of blade as the ball balloons straight up for extra cover to take a simple catch. 184/4 Previous NextSee all photosSai Kishore302819.336022010.1 to AM Rahane, Sai Kishore gets his man.

Misses, and Saha does the rest.. 104/2See all photosSpencer Johnson403518.758320012.3 to RD Gaikwad, Huge appeal for caught behind and the umpire has given it. Gaikwad is walking off as well. Back of a length ball angling across the batter, who looks for a pull, gets an inside edge with the ball going to the keeper. That's a rather important wicket. 127/3See all photosMohit Sharma403619.004211019.3 to Sameer Rizvi, Straight down long-on's throat! On-pace full ball on off stump.

Gill reviews. This is a good length ball on off and Gill looks to play a check-pull in front of square, but the ball stays marginally low and hits him on the back leg. Will height save Gill? Tense GT fans in the crowd.... and that's three reds! The Titans captain is gone for a five-ball eight. 28/14.3 to WP Saha, straight to deep square leg! The fielder was present there for the short ball, and the ploy has paid off. Short of good length ball coming into Saha. He bravely goes for the pull. Drags the shot behind square, and it doesn't have the height to go all the way.. 34/2See all photosMustafizur Rahman403027.5010500016.2 to Rashid Khan, that's...... gone! Good length ball on leg, and this is the cutter in fact. Ball scrambles Rashid as he clears the front leg and tries to club it over the leg side. Totally mistimed, and Rachin is in the action again at deep square leg. 121/718.2 to R Tewatia, full ball wider outside off stump. Tewatia shapes up to clobber it over long off but it doesn't have the power. Rachin stays on the long-off boundary line, and takes a simple catch. 129/8See all photosTushar Deshpande402125.2512110011.5 to DA Miller, Rahane with an athletic effort to take a stunning catch! Deshpande searches for the yorker on leg stump.

Stunning catch. 96/415.2 to Azmatullah Omarzai, this time Rachin takes the catch! Redeems himself. Short and wide ball. Omarzai tries to slap it over backward point but ends up flat-batting a shot high up in the air. Rachin runs across from extra cover to cover and brings out the reverse-cup catching technique again...however, this time it sticks! Takes a tumble on the followthrough but sports a smile as the ball is firmly in his grasp. 118/6See all photosRavindra Jadeja201507.5021000Daryl Mitchell201819.00220107.3 to V Shankar, vintage Dhoni!

Sudharsan shows aggression by trying to lift it over long on, but checks it in the last moment.

As it was Titans' first such offence of the season, Gill received a fine of INR 12 lakhs.For the second game running, Chepauk offered no wickets to the home team's spinners. Instead, it was the fast bowlers led by Deepak Chahar (2 for 28) and Tushar Deshpande (2 for 21) who did all the damage. The times, they are a'changin.Rachiiiiin Rachin!Rachin is a back-foot player. Yet his drives are the best part of his game. They look so natural. Almost instinctive. This is basically a result of a switch in mindset, which was very apparent at the ODI World Cup, where he gave himself permission to go hard at the ball. Now watching him, there's almost no bias.He was straight-driving sixes. He was front-foot pulling boundaries. He was pouncing on rare short balls from Rashid Khan. This was a batter showing off just how early he was picking length and just how good his hand-eye coordination is. He was never out of position. He was never rushed. He never even looked like he was trying. His 46 off 20 balls is already in the Super Kings hall of fame because he hit nine boundaries, the joint-fifth-most by any CSK batter inside the powerplay in all IPL history.Dube destroys spinLeft-arm spinner Sai Kishore and Rashid Khan were immense in helping Titans shut down Mumbai Indians in their first match of the season. Here they were almost not allowed to finish their full quota of overs. Because Shivam Dube.The first ball of the 11th over resulted in Ajinkya Rahane's wicket with the score on 104 for 2. The second and third were sent up into orbit by the one of the league's best spin-hitters.Dube's story might well be the strongest argument in favour of role-clarity in T20 cricket. Here was a power-hitter who had only one fifty from his first 22 IPL innings because teams kept using him as a finisher. He isn't that, because he is still a work in progress against fast bowling.All the power he had was going to waste, until CSK came calling in 2022 and decided they'd use him against the slower bowlers; against the kind of people he can just plant that front foot down and use all of his wingspan. Even Rashid wasn't able to keep Dube quiet. That's the quality of his spin-hitting. He has 57 sixes since the switch to yellow and that puts him level with IPL legend Andre Russell and Liam Livingstone and behind only Jos Buttler (59).Sameer Rizvi hit his first ball in the IPL for six, off Rashid Khan•BCCIRizvi risesAt the fall of Dube's wicket, with less than two overs to go, Chepauk might have expected Dhoni to stride out to the middle. The camera certainly did. It kept panning to him in the dressing room.Instead, it was 20-year old Rizvi who stepped up. And he swept the first ball that he faced in the IPL for six. That it happened to be Rashid bowling and that he hit him for another six - this one a bit of a mis-hit as he charged out of his crease and swung himself almost off his feet - only added to the occasion. If this is the new CSK, there's going to be a few more special years ahead.Pace, not spin, in ChennaiDeepak Chahar was finding that his slower ball wasn't working tonight; that the pitch instead of offering grip only let it slide onto the bat. But Chepauk didn't totally bail on its team. There was a moment in the third over when a little bit of a low bounce resulted in Shubman GIll's wicket. He was lbw while playing that front-foot pull shot with an angled bat that usually goes to the boundary.More mischief happened as a team that is not really known for their fielding pulled off three incredible catches - Dhoni diving full length to his right to get rid of Vijay Shankar, Ajinkya Rahane running in from midwicket and diving forward to snap up a David Miller helicopter shot at deep midwicket, and Ravindra gobbling up a skier from Azmatullah Omarzai.The Titans chase never got going. They had only 34 on the board when their openers fell, 114 when their top-scorer Sai Sudharsan fell, and at 129 for 8 they were even in danger of being bowled out.

Not quite the thriller tonight like the IPL 2023 final with CSK hammering Titans in a big win. Tomorrow we will see you for Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Mumbai Indians. Till then, adios!11.41pm TIme for the presentation. Couple of sponsor awards to be distributed before we chat with the winning captain Ruturaj Gaikwad, who has now made it 2-0 as an IPL captain. Here he is: \"(second win in a row, thrilling?) Today's game was near to perfect game, in the sense of batting-bowling-fielding, all three departments. Against a team like Gujarat, we had to produce this kind of performance. (100+ runs in first ten overs) In Chennai when you are not sure how the wicket will be, you must bat well irrespective of when you're batting. Having wickets in the last ten really helps here. Personally, thought Rachin batted and put us against in the game. Jinx and Shivam played good roles. Not to forget our youngster Rizvi as well. (Assessment of Dube) Just confidence. When he came here the management worked with him personally, Mahi bhai worked with him personally. He knows what role he is playing and which bowler to take on. A big plus for us. (Fielding today) I think pretty much same, I am impressed as well. Maybe we have got 1-2 extra youngsters in the team. Great effort from Jinx even in the last game and this game.\"Up next Shivam Dube, the Player of the Match: (Three franchises, finally blossoming here?) This franchise is something different from all others. They are giving me the freedom. They want me to do better and I also want to win some matches. (Whacking short balls) I have worked in that way. It is helping me. I know they will bowl me some short balls and I'm ready for that. (Role - flexible?) They want me to do the same thing I did today. They want me to score with a higher strike-rate and that is what I'm doing.\"CSK zoom right up to No. 1 on the IPL 2024 points table.Deepak Chahar, from the winning side: (Three powerplay overs for him) Generally when I play, I bowl three powerplay overs. It is a difficult task but its the role team has given and I try to do it. (Two bouncers per over) Obviously it helps. If you previously bowled a bouncer early, then the batter is ready for the full ball. But now the batter has to stay on his toes and has to expect the second bouncer. (More bounce on this pitch?) There is always bounce but it is usually slower. We didn't see much dew either. (Chatting with Gaikwad instead of MS these days) Now I see both sides now [laughs], I get confused where to see. Ruturaj is leading well.\"11.26pm So CSK's contingent of Mumbai and Maharashtra players seal the deal against the Titans who themselves had many Tamil Nadu boys in their team. Dube with that blazing half-century, Deshpande with 2-21 in four overs, Rahane with some stunning catches and Gaikwad with some runs and his job as captain.Jokes aside, don't forget the contribution from Mustafizur Rahman and Deepak Chahar as well, who shared four wickets between them. Ravindra's 46 runs were also crucial, as were their lower-order cameos.Tough outing for the Titans tonight after Gill fell early. They never really seemed to be in the hunt in the second innings. Here's the losing captain Shubman Gill: \"They outplayed us when they were batting and when they bowled their execution was spot on. We backed ourselves to get a good powerplay score but once we couldn't we were always playing catch up. (Bowling effort reflections) In T20 you can always talk about 10-15 runs here and there but eventually it is about how much they got. We were expecting to chase anything between 190 to 200 but we can talk about how we could've stopped a few more boundaries. Rather have games like these at the start of the tournament. (This wicket) Going into the match chasing, we always expected to chase 190-200 because it was a good wicket with grass covering. We let ourselves down while batting. (Role as leader of GT) Lots of new ... experiencing lot of different things. We had two finals in the past two years...exciting times.\"M RAGUPATHY : \"POTM should be given Rachin Ravindra for his batting as well had wonderful 3 catches !\"19.6•Pathirana to Umesh Yadav, no runfull ball just outside off stump.

Runs were flowing at a breakneck pace. You wouldn't be blamed for thinking you were watching a video game. The carnage in Hyderabad resulted in an 11-year-old IPL record falling, RCB's seemingly insurmountable total of 263 from 2013 falling by the wayside thanks to a breathtaking, collective show from the Sunrisers Hyderabad batters. They notched up the highest total in the 16-year history of the IPL - 277 for 3 - but then, just as incredibly, Mumbai Indians almost paid them back with the same coin, their batters coming out with a nothing-to-lose attitude. Eventually, they ran out of steam and finished on 246 for 5, the highest IPL total in a losing cause.Travis Head set the pace on the night, striking an 18-ball half-century, the fastest for SRH in the IPL. His record lasted roughly four overs, Abhishek Sharma slamming a 16-ball fifty to relegate him to No. 2. An hour after that, Heinrich Klaasen cut loose to seemingly bat MI out of the contest. But the sixes kept rolling off the Mumbai bats too, helping them keep up with the asking rate for most of the chase, eventually falling only 31 short.RelatedSwashbuckling. Radiant. High-octane. We have a brand-new SRH'They missed a trick up front' - Moody (and Klaasen) on Mumbai holding back BumrahIPL and Hawk-Eye join hands to end debate over above-waist no-ballsStats - Sunrisers break record for highest ever IPL totalNever were more runs scored in a men's T20 match (523). Never were most sixes hit in a men's T20 (38). At the end of the close to four-hour six-fest, only two bowlers returned with an economy rate of under ten an over.The perfect Head-startHead, in for Marco Jansen, continued from where he had left off on his previous tour of India. He was off the mark with a four off IPL debutant Kwena Maphaka, the 17-year-old who played for South Africa at the Under-19 World Cup earlier this year. Head was given a life when Tim David dropped him at mid-off off Hardik Pandya's first ball. But there was no looking back from there.Head smacked two fours and two sixes in a 22-run Maphaka over before hitting two fours and a six off Gerald Coetzee in an over that went for 23 to end the powerplay. Head had scored 59 of the 81 SRH made in the first six overs. In his next over, though, Coetzee bowled a short and wide one, which the batter could only carve to deep backward point.Abhishek shows his mettleHead's inclusion in the XI meant Abhishek had to move down the order, and he walked in at No. 3 after Mayank Agarwal fell in the fifth over. Abhishek got going with a pull off Coetzee and then meted out a special treatment to the legspin Piyush Chawla, hitting him for three sixes in an over. That helped SRH notch up their 100 in just seven overs, their second-fastest in the IPL.Abhishek also tore into Maphaka's third over, hitting him for a sequence of 4, 6, 6, 4 to complete his fifty and snatch the record from Head. The key was how early he picked the length of the bowlers. He hit seven sixes in his 23-ball stay for 63 runs, before heaving a half-tracker that Chawla fired in seam-up at 112.8kph straight to deep midwicket.Heinrich Klaasen hit another rampaging half-century•AP Photo / Mahesh KumarKlaasen, Markram add finishing touchesWith nine overs to go and two right-hand batters in the middle, Hardik Pandya sensed an opportunity to get left-arm spinner Shams Mulani in the game. That played into the hands of Klaasen, though, who is a spin-basher. In T20s since January 2022, no batter who has faced at least 500 balls had a higher strike rate against spin than Klaasen's 174.38 before the start of the game.True to form, he smacked Mulani over long-off to get his rhythm going. Klaasen then hit a six each off Hardik and Jasprit Bumrah as SRH crossed 200 in the 15th over. Aiden Markram, at the other end, hit a six and a four but was happy to give the strike to his South Africa team-mate. Klaasen brought up his fifty off 22 balls, which was only the third quickest on the night.Klaasen hit two successive sixes in the last over bowled by Mulani to take Sunrisers past RCB's record score. SRH added 63 in the last four overs to post the fourth-highest total in all men's T20s.Mumbai lose their fizzRohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan kicked off Mumbai's reply in fine fashion. Rohit muscled Bhuvneshwar Kumar down the ground before hitting Jaydev Unadkat - brought in for T Natarajan, who had a niggle - for back-to-back sixes. Kishan meanwhile took 23 off Bhuvneshwar's second over, hitting him for a four and three sixes. Kishan then slogged Shahbaz Ahmed to deep midwicket, but Rohit kept going.He whipped Pat Cummins' second ball over midwicket before miscuing a pull to fall for 26 off just 12. Only twice in the IPL has Rohit scored more - 37 in April 2015 vs RCB, and 27 in May 2015 vs Chennai Super Kings - off the first 12 balls he faced.Naman Dhir and Tilak Varma also kept Mumbai abreast with the required rate. They found boundaries regularly, with Tilak leading the charge, and added 84 off 37 for the third wicket. But once they fell within 21 balls of each other, MI lost momentum. David managed to hit a few into the stands, but by then it was too late.Travis HeadAbhishek SharmaHeinrich KlaasenSunrisers HyderabadMumbai IndiansSRH vs MIIndian Premier LeagueS Sudarshanan is a sub-editor at ESPNcricinfo. @Sudarshanan7LanguageEnglishWin ProbabilitySRH 100%SRHMI100%50%100%SRH InningsMI InningsOver 20 • MI 246/5SRH won by 31 runsPowered by Smart StatsMatch CoverageAll Match NewsShock and awe all around at Head's hair-raising hundred Head clubbed the fourth-fastest IPL century off 39 balls in a dazzling display that left teammates and opponents amazedWho has the best batting average in the IPL?Also: was Sri Lanka's 531 the highest Test total to not feature an individual century?Swashbuckling.

All sorts of records were broken tonight and you can read all about it fifth in that list!\">here. Tom Moody, during our half-time show also felt Mumbai Indians missed a trick with their bowling plans by holding Jasprit Bumrah back for Heinrich Klaasen. Sudarshanan's report will also be up soon, so you can get a recap of this thriller. That will be all from us today. It was great fun bringing all the action to you. On behalf of Hemant, Chandan, Venkat and everyone else at ESPNcricinfo, a very good night to you all11.35pm And it's time for the presentation ceremony.Abhishek Sharma is the player of the match. Here's what he has to say: \"[Confidence from Mushtaq Ali] It carries a lot of confidence from there. We have a lot of Punjabi boys in the team and we carried the confidence. The message for the batters has been pretty simple: go out and express yourself, and that has been great for me. Head is one of my favourite batters, I really admire his batting. Had a great time batting with him. I had a chance to talk to Brian Lara last night, that really helped me. [On his bowling] If you see me, you'll know that I enjoy bowling more than I bat. I know I can do well with the ball as well.\"SRH captain, Pat Cummins: \"[Did he think it could be chased down?] Not until we bowled (laughs). It was an amazing game. [Abhishek Sharma] Really impressive striker of the ball. In the IPL you play under a lot of pressure, but the freedom he has played with was amazing. You never play for 270 but we wanted to be really positive and with the impact player rule you have more batting as well. It's obviously a good wicket so you know you're going to go for a few boundaries, but just have to stick to the plans. I think cutters worked.\"11.20pm What an exhilerating contest this was and SRH come out on top in the IPL's biggest run-fest! Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Aiden Markram and of course Heinrich Klaasen sent the ball to all parts as Sunrisers raced to the highest score in IPL history, as well as in any domestic or franchise T20 league. But Mumbai Indians gave them a scare as Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan began with a bang. Tilak Varma continued their momentum hammering 64 off 34. But a tight three overs in the middle that saw Sunrisers concede just 18 runs turned it around and David's 22-ball 42 and Shepherd's 6-ball 15 came too late. There will be questions today as well about Hardik's captaincy, and his batting.Travis Head: \"The batting's done an exceptional job in the last two games so feels good to contribute. We were pretty aggressive in the first game as well and that's one thing we want to do at the top. [On matchups] We knew it might swing in the first couple, I'm pleased I could target both the off side and leg side. Earlier I would sometimes just target the leg side. The experience from Bhuvi and Cummins in the end was class.\"Hardik Pandya: \"The wicket was good but 277, no matter how good or bad you bowl, if the opposition get 277 that means they batted very well. [Bowlers] were good. It was tough out there. Close to 500 runs were scored so the wicket was helping the batters. We could have tried a few different things, but we have a young bowling attack and I liked what I saw today. If the ball goes this much in the crowd, it's definitely different to run around and complete the overs in time. Everyone batted really well, counting Tilak, Ro, Ishan. There are just few things we need to do right and we'll be alright. [On Maphaka] I think he was fantastic you know. Coming into your first game and getting overwhelmed by this kind of crowd and he showed he had the heart. Even though he went for runs, he looked alright, he wanted to back his skillsets and that's something that's fantastic. He has the skillset, just that he needs some game time.\"Rob: \"Is that the highest ever T20 score in a losing cause?\" Surprisingly enough, it's the fifth in that list!Fiaz Laghari: \"Pat Cummins deserves a pat on his shoulders for such an amazing 15th and penultimate over\"19.6•Markande to Shepherd, no runLegbreak on a length again, Shepherd can't connect and SRH have their first win of the season!19.54Markande to Shepherd, FOUR runsOn a length outside off, punched out through cover point for another boundary19.44Markande to Shepherd, FOUR runsFull outside off, Shepherd moves across the stumps and smacks it down the ground for a boundary19.3•Markande to Shepherd, no runLegbreak tossed up outside off, Shepherd can't connect19.26Markande to Shepherd, SIX runsLength ball outside off, Shepherd frees his arm and deposits over long-on.

Khaleel's around-the-wicket-angle works. He's cramped Samson for room, who tried to back away and chop the 141ks into-the-pitch ball through point. Ends up nicking it to Pant. Khaleel's jubilant, DC's new-ball bowlers have made it their powerplay.. 30/2See all photosMukesh Kumar4049112.25872101.5 to YBK Jaiswal, Is that one stump out the ground or two? Looks like off stump was flattened and middle rattled. The flying bails was shiver-inducing. Seam-bowling special. 141ks on a length, angling in from around the wicket, decked in to cramp Jaiswal for room on the flick, ball ricocheted off the bat onto the stumps.. 9/1See all photosAnrich Nortje4048112.008440017.2 to DC Jurel, Paddled onto off stump, that's a rare visual. Jurel picked the fast, full ball from outside the offside tramline, seemed to have middled it but unintentionally sent the bails on a sexy-looking flight. Second of those on the night after Jaiswal's dismissal. Nortje is pumped. 142/5Axar Patel402115.256100013.3 to R Ashwin, Ashwin tries to clear deep midwicket but can't. 95ks length ball angling in, he saw it in his half and tried went for a stand-up slog sweep. Got a decent chunk but not enough to clear Stubbs, who took it and swivelled back, the step was within the cushion. Ashwin's given RR's innings some impetus though. 90/4Kuldeep Yadav4041110.25513207.2 to JC Buttler, Beaten on the reverse, lbw appeal turned down. Kuldeep took the matter, and literally Rishabh's hands, into his own and signalled the T. Where did this pitch though? Buttler tried playing it on the up, got beaten and ball hit just under the knee-roll, outer-half of the pad. It has pitched in line and Kuldeep might as well have Hawk-Eye tech embedded in him cos the ball is projected to land in line and go on to smash leg peg. It landed around a back of length too, which makes his conviction look even better. Buttler tried to break out of his struggle but perishes in the attempt. 36/3See all photosDelhi Capitals (T: 186 runs from 20 ovs)BATTING RBM4s6sSRDavid Warner c Sandeep Sharma b Avesh Khan49345553144.11Mitchell Marsh b Burger23121750191.66Ricky Bhui c †Samson b Burger023000.00Rishabh Pant (c)†c †Samson b Chahal28264221107.69Tristan Stubbs not out 44234423191.30Abishek Porel c Buttler b Chahal910100090.00Axar Patel not out 15132310115.38Extras(lb 1, w 4)5TOTAL20 Ov (RR: 8.65)173/5Did not bat: Sumit Kumar, Kuldeep Yadav, Anrich Nortje, Mukesh Kumar Fall of wickets: 1-30 (Mitchell Marsh, 3.2 ov), 2-30 (Ricky Bhui, 3.4 ov), 3-97 (David Warner, 11.2 ov), 4-105 (Rishabh Pant, 13.1 ov), 5-122 (Abishek Porel, 15.3 ov) • DRSBOWLINGOMRWECON0s4s6sWDNBTrent Boult302909.6683200Nandre Burger302929.66951003.2 to MR Marsh, Gone through the gate!

The after-holi pink hair of Burger sway as he celebrates with full vigour. 30/13.4 to RK Bhui, Bhui bounced out! Burger bangs it short at 138.5kph - it seemed more like 158.3! - Bhui only tries to fend it away. The ball gets big on him and lobs off his front glove.

No fifty for Warner but the umpires want to take another look. Length ball angling away, he once again flashes hard at it and gets a thick outside edge.

When the ball seamed and swung, accounting for Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson and Jos Buttler, Parag played watchfully but turned 16 off 20 into a match-winning 84 off 45.Despite the Parag assault, Delhi Capitals would have felt confident they could chase down 186 what with the dew and reduced seam movement on offer, but Nandre Burger, Royals' Impact Player, made early dents with the ball, Yuzvendra Chahal picked wickets, and Avesh Khan and Sandeep Sharma closed out superbly with yorkers and wide lines.RR batters dance to the ball's tuneDC's new-ball bowlers might not have the extreme pace, but Mukesh Kumar and Khaleel Ahmed maximised the early seam movement by bowling areas where they kept attacking the stumps. Even though RR looked to weather the storm, they couldn't afford to do so for too long lest they batted themselves out of the game.RelatedIt's time to change your opinion about Riyan Parag, even if he won'tGood early signs, but the task's cut out for Pant nowSangakkara: Maturity and hunger set Riyan Parag 2.0 apartParag: I have the power to deal with yorkers, short ballsMukesh bowled Jaiswal, Khaleel drew an edge from Samson during his third over in the powerplay, and Kuldeep Yadav trapped Buttler lbw on the reverse-sweep. At 36 for 3 in the eighth over, it could be argued decisive damage had been caused already.Ashwin the batter takes flightEven as Parag struggled to reach even a run a ball in the first half of his innings, R Ashwin was promoted and he hit three sixes. The idea probably was to delay the introduction of Shimron Hetmyer and, in the process, make sure they didn't use their Impact substitution on a batter. Not only did Ashwin hold out until the ideal point of entry for the bigger hitters, he hit DC's best bowlers on paper, Kuldeep and Anrich Nortje, for three sixes. These blows took RR's run rate past six for the first time. In the 11th over of the innings.Parag takes overPlaying on painkillers and flu medication after three days of illness, Parag took over after Ashwin got out. The switch up started with a pulled six off Kuldeep in the 13th over, continued with 6,4 and 4 in the 15th to somewhat damage Khaleel's figures, and ended with a glorious takedown of Nortje in the 20th over, which went for two sixes and 25 runs in all. Hetmyer, who started his innings in the 18th over, ended with an unbeaten 14 off seven.Sizzling Burger worth the waitIt was clear RR were going lengths to get the services of Burger over Powell. The Parag assault in the final third of the innings helped them make their minds up. And Burger immediately vindicated the decision by getting rid of the marauding Mitchell Marsh and Ricky Bhui in the fourth over. On a night that Trent Boult went wicketless, forget taking his usual first-over wicket, Burger made sure RR caused the early damage. Marsh was bowled through swing at high space, and Bhui gloved a bouncer.Chahal and Co apply middle-overs squeezeThe two big left-arm seamers took on the challenge of bowling inside the powerplay, which also probably meant less pressure on the remaining four bowlers to bowl 14 between them.3:23Moody: Sandeep is the most underrated bowler in the IPLDavid Warner looked threatening, especially with a known asking rate and the conditions generally improving for batting, but then Avesh got him out with a full and wide ball. Pundits have already pointed out his open front foot has opened up the off side on straight balls but has also taken him far away from the ball when it is bowled wide. It seemed here that he took out a fishing pole to reach this one, and the edge flew to Sandeep at short third.Yuzvendra Chahal then took out two left-hand batters, Risbhabh Pant and Ishan Porel. Ashwin could have ended the match in the 17th over had Boult taken the straightforward catch from Tristan Stubbs, but the reprieved batter made it interesting with three sixes and a four off the next six balls that he faced.

Nine in a row, and it is the longest such streak at any point in the IPL, says Sampath. That's all we have for you all tonight. Do join us for another cracker - RCB take on KKR in Bengaluru - tomorrow. Till then, take care, ciao!11:41pm Time for the presentationSanju Samson, Royals captain: \"The way we started, the first ten overs, we were like Rovman, be ready you might have to bat! The IPL is changing and we all have to be flexible. Earlier it was about 11 players, now it is about all 15 players. Me and Sanga had a lot of chat between 15th and 17th over before deciding the Impact Player. It's all about gauging in which zone they are. You have to look at that and take your decision. I saw Sandy was calm and Avesh was also looking good, so i went with that. Riyan Parag has been a big name in the last few years. Wherever I go, people ask me about him. There is something very special he can give to Indian cricket.\"Riyan Parag, Player of the Match: \"Emotions are settled, mum's here as well. She's seen the struggles, this feels special. I know what my ability is and I never let that change - irrespective of whether I perform or not. A lot to do with the domestic season, where I scored a lot of runs. Someone in the top four has to take it deep. First match, Sanju bhaiya did it, today I did it. I had to work very hard. I was on bed in the last three days. I could manage it today.\"11:25pm High fives all around in the Royals camp. Ninth successive win by a home team this season. The bowling changes from Samson were spot on. Never let the batters settle and some excellent death bowling saw them eke out a 12-run win. This was after a Riyan Parag special enthralled one and all in Jaipur. That was clean-hitting of a different class, capitalising on his superb form. Axar was thrifty with the ball for Capitals, but barring Warner, none of the batters could get going.Rishabh Pant, Capitals captain: \"Definitely disappointed. The best thing to do from here to learn from it. The bowlers did well through the 15-16 overs. But the batters did well at the death, hopefully we do better in the next game. The platform that Warner-Marsh gave was very nice. We had to save wickets. We had to consolidate but at the end we had a lot to cover up. [On not bowling Nortje to Parag earlier] There is always one or the other option, but we wanted to finish Nortje in the death overs. Sometimes you are going to go for runs. Didn't go well for us today.\"Avesh Khan, Royals bowler: \"[On the death-over yorkers] My plan is always clear. One side was longer, so my plan was to bowl wide yorkers. I was giving myself five seconds and only thought about executing them. My focus is always on the execution and back my yorkers. Enjoying myself here because we have Sandeep, Boult, Burger, all of whom have different skills. Samson gives me freedom to execute and only steps in if he sees I am struggling. I try to improve myself everytime. In T20s I try to reinvent myself. I never think about selection and only practice what I want to bowl.\"19.61Avesh Khan to Axar Patel, 1 runAnother very full ball on middle, he can only whip it to deep midwicket.

Though it was perhaps predictable that it came at the M Chinnaswamy stadium, where the small ground really does favour the chasing team. That, on Friday, was Kolkata Knight Riders, who overcame a Virat Kohli masterclass to chase down 183 and claim the two points.Narine stars in 500th gameKKR's opening partnership had been a problem area in recent years. But they won this game with it. They had to score a lot of their target inside the first six overs, not just because of the field restrictions, but because that's when the ball is hard and new and that's when it comes onto the bat. RCB's innings already showed that as it got softer and older, going into the wicket and taking pace off became mighty effective. Andre Russell (2-29) and Harshit Rana (2-39) used it to good effect.This, though, is the KKR gameplan regardless of the venue they're playing at because they keep using Sunil Narine at the top, giving him a licence to play those 30 off 10 cameos. He overachieved, which was fitting on his 500th T20, making 47 off 22. Phil Salt did plenty of damage too. He very nearly didn't play this IPL. At the end of the powerplay, KKR had 85 for 0. They'd taken down almost 50% of their target in just 30% of the overs with 100% of their wickets still in hand.Upon that platform, Venkatesh Iyer raised a half-century and Shreyas Iyer ensured he was there till the end, which came as early as the 17th over. RCB's lopsided line-up - world-class batters and inexperienced bowlers - was laid bare. The most economical of their three main bowlers was Yash Dayal (11.5)Venkatesh Iyer worked past back pain and made a half-century•Associated PressKohli going big\"I've still got it,\" he said, before realising he's being broadcast all over the world and he needed to be a bit less. \"I guess.\"Kohli has often said he has nothing to prove, but the fact that he said that at the end of RCB's last match suggests there has been talk about the way he bats in T20 cricket.Usually cricketers don't get riled up by talk that comes from outside. That's white noise and they spend their whole lives ignoring it, hard though it certainly is.Kohli saying he's still got it feels like there's some input from within the Indian team about how they want him to go about his business. His performance in this IPL - which has become a bit of a showcase for players hoping to make it to the T20 World Cup in June - has reflected a change in his game.A previously risk-averse batter, a limited-overs run-machine who sets his stall out to play the whole innings, is willing to put less of a price on his wicket. And he's been doing that by hitting the ball in the air a lot more than he used to. This is from data collected from the 2014 season onwards. It really does tell a tale.\n","\n","Commentary 10 text:\n"," Today's Cricket Match | Cricket Update | Cricket News | ESPNcricinfoMatches (10)IPL (2)BAN v IND [W] (1)County DIV1 (2)County DIV2 (3)RHF Trophy (1)Bangladesh vs Zimbabwe (1) PreviousRESULT • 54th Match • IPL • T20 • LucknowKKR235/6LSG(16.1/20 ov, T:236) 137KKR won by 98 runsScheduleTableReportSeries4th T20I • SylhetBangladesh WomenIndia WomenToday10:00 AMMatch starts in 4 hrs 18 minsScheduleSeries55th Match • IPL • T20 • WankhedeMumbai IndiansSunrisers HyderabadToday2:00 PMMatch yet to beginScheduleTableVideosSeriesStumps • Starts 10:00 AM • 20th Match • County DIV1 • FC • ManchesterKENT(24 ov, T:164) 261 & 71/1LANCS(f/o) 92 & 332Day 3 -
